hello fellow traders and welcome to this
second part
of the webinar over unconventional forex
trading and of course I suggest you to
watch the previous video which is the
first part basically I'm doing this
second part because  as it
appears the less the frequency
I publish videos the higher the frequency I
receive mails and requests of every
kind and also Skype contacts so I just
made a kind of Appendix to the previous
video as a second part which somehow I
will speak about another topic very
briefly and I strongly beg you to watch
the entire video first from the
beginning to the end because a lot of
emails I got they were asking
something that was already explained or
answered in the video and by asking to
the people that were sending me mail
they were saying: ... "oh but I just saw the
first 10 minutes!"... whatever....  I know it
takes a moment to explain things but I
will put myself available for a reply of
course when there is an email with some
sense not very short messages or
nonsense messages but sometimes you ask
something that is then explained maybe
at the 25th minute of the video so take
the patience to watch at least once the
video completely ok so all this said
just to go directly to the topic
today I will today it's Friday is the
26th* of October 2019
and Markets now are
closed and I will do just a brief
*- (Saturday has just begun) -
explanation of something which compares
somehow because I got requests on this
with so I would put some practical
trading examples I will expose
why manual trading is definitely better
than automated trading for as regards
of course retail traders especially
indeed man are trading anyway requires a
good quality of market analysis and
requires therefore the proper tools
which in my case is my currency
strength meter u.U.F.O., that
I have built by myself and for myself on
the ante for meta trader platform so all
this said let's go directly to the point
and I will start let's see that see I
will start with this ok so if you watch
the previous video you will see it will
end with a balance and some examples for
acid are the risk management and
that good quality of the analysis and
the results that a good quality quality
quality of analysis my case based on
math can lead to some impressive results
or at least good results for someone
repressive now markets are closed as I
said and so you see why you were forward
that was still running somehow so it's a
kind of screenshot this one is just
static now because there is no data feed
basically so it can also disappear
that doesn't matter and in the previous
video you saw a balance that was then in
the statement you know of MT4... this
week I traded not that much days because
we have to mention something that yes
can be done also an automated trading
but let's say that with mono trading you
have also to focus on certain aspects of
the markets which regard for example the
fact that it's better stay out of
trading when some markets are closed and
in this case in this way we got Tokyo
session that was closed for holidays
on Monday I think, so there are some days and
even the day after where where markets
are more ranging than trending unless
there are other reasons for them to trend normally
it happens this so there are
days where there is no practical trend
that can give you a kind of
relaxed trading because there is a kind
of inner oscillation rather than trying
even if sometimes there are very big ox
oscillations but within a range and
with the trend I feel more confident at
least because you can catch better moves
so also with the Brexit issue that is
somehow leading GBP in a very crazy way
with a lot of pips that can be done and
unfortunately I was out a couple of days
for medical reasons so I just traded
some days okay so as you can see here we
are starting from the negative side you
know of the trade when you have to close
your trades because you're going with
the risk management that I was talking
about in the previous video anyway when
you go over a certain percentage of
negative percentage of your balance and
anyway if you remember
oh let's also do this for a second we
were the last screenshot with this one
with the October the 18th of October at
11:43 with this balance okay and
basically I made some extra trades this
week and as I was showing you here sorry
okay we have here now we have a balance
of fifty two thousand eight hundred and
twelve units yes of course also we can
see it here okay and basically this was
exactly is exactly what I was showing
you now so there is now a new statement
that is dated
25th of October yes now I said 26th
because now is already Saturday here okay?..
...anyway... I'm talking about this week
within the Friday because now is Friday for
this statement... is regarding Friday the
25th of October at 22 and 55 okay so
this is the very latest statement that I
made from this week and the results were
not that much I could have trade even
better but I got times that I was not
that was not possible for me being at
the computer and make an analysis and
save some time for that so I made just a
couple of trades anyway we can see that
from the final balance of fifty thousand , fifty five .31 units I increased
to
of about two thousand and seven hundred
and fifty units okay so that was in a
way of positive result going
further and I was while I was willing to
talk about manual trading versus the
automated trading and there are weeks
where Forex can be for it's market can
be more predictable and less stressful
other weeks is not the same this is why
that out there are also exogenous
factors that we must assume and think
with our own mind and figure out somehow
that can be more hard to read
analysis of the market and I told you a
minute ago that basically there are some
conditions when certain markets are
closed that influence all the day because
their currency in this case for example
the Japanese yen were not moving
therefore there was the need to keep
them in a range and as all the
currencies are correlated connected
interrelated one to each other also the
other currency pairs were somehow
influenced by the ranging of just one
currency okay or at least more limited
because of the need of maintaining
stability at least this is my analysis
for this week and I was dis I'm saying
this now because there is something that
I was hitting in the web of course on
YouTube and so it's public so I think I
can at least show one thing in relation
to kind of automation I think that was
something like that but what I wanted to
show you is that for those for all the
emails that I get where they're asking
me: "... do you think about making a uUFO which...
... is fully automated?".
This is a wrong approach to the thing
because uUFO
which means
unconventional Forex Outlook or
unconventional Forex observer it's a
tool to read in real time the trending
of the strength of the currencies that
it's a kind of 75% of the analysis is
just leading indication that defines on
which currencies I have to focus then
comes another part that takes in
consideration
the market conditions and then the in
chart analysis to identify the highs the
lows good spots were position my trades
that completes the analysis and prepares
for the trading ok so there's a kind of
process that involves multiple aspects
so uUFO in itself the moment is
just a part of the strategy cannot be
automated because the final decision is
is not because now here I see NZD vs CAD
I'm going to trade NZD vs CAD...
I'm receiving
something like a filter that says
take a look to NZD and CAD but
if a move already occurred I know that by
passing these two currencies I will take
a look to others because these are
already gone so it's filter that can
tell me it's time to take action on
these currencies or... these currencies have
revealed already their move therefore I
know that they can be considered in the
opposite direction or that I can use
other the other six currencies remained
so I make a kind of analysis on six
cases rather than eight currencies okay
but then I considered also other factors
and as I told you I was on the web and I
took just a screenshot okay and let's
talk about this example
I went into this page and I saw that was
a streaming .. so it was in real time
and there was this challenge,
a trading challenge of 1 million pound
challenge where I think it's a good
example of how bad the automation can be
for my reasons at least ok and we see
here a challenge on the gbp/usd I hope
let me check if you can see it better
let's make it even better... here GBP USD
gbpusd ok so this account has this balance..
this balance and was making this
loss
because since the beginning of the day
was injecting at this level a BUY order
that for more than six hours 10 hours ... sorry
was leading to this result now we
can see now how the GBP went today okay but
let me tell you that that was an
automation as you can see we have these
values and we have this order injected
by kind of analysis that it's also made
on a single currency pair
so doesn't consider cannot consider the
strength and weakness of the eight
currencies that are in the Forex market
okay was just on an application of
something on the chart of gbp/usd so
maybe yeah this account was five hundred and thirty one thousand pounds
okay was in negative was
trading a volume of 10 lots and
with - 6500 pounds but in my opinion
by giving to the market that amount for ten
hours it means you have wasted a day
even if then it retraces even if this
loss is the 1% almost 1% so it's within
the parameters of a good money
management there was this issue about
creating a very poor portfolio based on
one currency pair only and having a
negative exposition for ten hours if you
do day trading
you cannot do that every day at least
you have to bring home something ok or
if this is wrong you have to cut it
I think it's kind of a dangerous way to
put the things and to show the
automation because 10 lots is something
that of course we are talking about big
amounts of probably a demo account... I don't know
this but I don't want to investigate
further ok but I think it's very... see
here?... the time... so it was open since the
end of the markets since
Thursday the 24th that was opened and
was this negative
but I think for normal retail traders
simple people and even the majority
which are novice or inexperienced
it's a very bad example and is
automation
so just to counterbalance this which is
made what way what are these fucking
indicators sorry for the word indicators
but let me show you that what I did
today for as regards markets
okay so I took as well a screenshot
of my GBP was the trading okay because
the UFO is not loaded around the chart
it requires only the euro dollar chart
see here EURUSD one chart only on
the daily timeframe in this case and I
can read and have everything under my
control on my control and I will show
you I was here on this gbp/usd this is a
five minute charts that put it on a 15
minute chart so it makes sense okay so
on the date on this day on this Friday
this was the GBP was being okay and
as you can see I made a trade that I will show you in a moment at 10:00 so it was 10:00 on
the server time in the morning 10:00
a.m. at this level of price and I made
of course not buy, but SELL
okay making some good profit okay for
45 pips okay and
just to show you this is the gbp/usd at
15 minutes this is of course the chart
that I was showing you also this is a
screenshot just evidence okay this is a
sell order of one lot and it's already a
lot of a lot sorry for this... and as you can
see this level sell order was made here
we can check this one gbp/usd let's get the line... that's ...here it is
GBPUSD
here it is...
I also got of course some negatives but
who cares
so at 10:00
10:00 am on GBP SELL so not buy like the
automation okay at 1.28 around 1.28
1.28578 okay
1.28 this line is a little bit above let's
show you in a picture this line is a
little bit above just to give the
opportunity to see also the Sell order
line which is here so if this is one
1.28609
this one is 1 point something less
than 605 and so it's 1.2857
1.286...1.285...
okay?...  just a little bit
less was around this are a little bit
lower
okay hope this makes sense just too and
also let's take a look maybe this is the
15-minute chart okay so let's take a
look to the one-minute chart and in the
one-minute chart you can see even more
clearly which is one point two
around that value okay one point two
eight five
one point two eight five
okay.. GBP USD
.
well
so
I'm not getting why
certain hours of automated trade (same  effort that I can put with manual trading) they give such
a negative result because what I mean
for day-trading is that by the end of
the day you close your positions and
tomorrow is another day but this kind of
results
are not good and they are very bad
behavior example ... not only a bad
example... a bad behavior example ... very
dangerous because people that are
beginners can think:
"oh we can go like that..."
NO YOU CAN'T
you have to make your
own analysis and get some results sooner
or later the moment you are doing an
automation you don't know what it's
going on the moment you do the analysis
you know exactly what's goin' on  or
at least much better and if something is
not clear in your mind you know you can
quit this way (automation) you don't know what it's
going on and of course when you're at
the beginning of the trade and you see
you buy ... okay but then is retracing... is
retracing and then bang down again
you take for the day not swing trainning
especially when you have automations
they are dangerous okay so hope this
example and this...
this is of course the uUFO running...
so this is the result of the analysis of
the market not of the uUFO is in a certain way
anyway big helper for me is basically
everything because it uses math and
gives me numbers and it's a kind of
filtering very tight that I can perform
a good market analysis for manual trading...
it's the effort that I will do manually
chart after chart for 28 charts so
the 28 currency pairs every day that
instead of making that in hours I made
that in minutes and then I focus my
trading also with Excel spreadsheets and
with anyway chart analysis okay
so gbp/usd in that "bad example" was to buy
in this area and let it go that's wrong
first you have to close at the end of
the day and second
there was a SELL not a buy action to take
okay well
I know there are many questions whatever
and I hope that you enjoyed this video
and to say the good example of this I
know I respect everyone that trades I
don't like any way and I disagreed with
certain ways of showing Forex and ..
forex trading because this website had no
opportunity for example to have no
no comments ... but had advertisement and had
merchandising ... I do forex for a reason
because I wanted to crack somehow to be
capable or to realize something that
would have allowed me to hack or to
crack debug reverse-engineer the forex
market this personal passion prior than
trading and make
the retail trailer I'm not merchandising
my stuff and when I see websites or
YouTube channels where instead of giving
knowledge or good behavioral examples
they're there just to make
audience and sell merchandise you do a
merchandiser  .. you're
not a trader... or at least you can be a
trader as well you have my respect but
it's not good for the people is not
educational ok anyway we can have
lesson learning from this okay
the lesson learning is that
manual trading is definitely better and more effective than automated trading it
requires for you to be there and work
into the day trading but you get
results and you know what you're doing
Automation it's good to be in the
computation in the formulas that kind of
automation is nice because saves hours
and hours of work of daily work and
repetitive work okay but the other kind
of automation where orders are injected
based on a single chart and creating
basically a ghost portfolio of just
one currency pair in its ... :-( ...
I trade and hedge them together
so despite also some negatives results
but we can see that on around this time
between 9:30 and 10:00 as you may notice
I traded the GBP against all the
currencies so I created a kind of
diversification of my portfolio based on
the GBP that was weak
that anyway was weaker than the other
currencies
it's more than 75% of the job but then it takes also to enter because
there was not that much movement
45 pips... so it's good to have a
good entering position but was Friday and
even in Friday's where certain markets
are closing and they are not open till
next day is like they're closed for
holidays so that's why on the Fridays
there are not very good situations to
catch okay there is a kind of oddity a
kind of mysterious something that cannot
be predicted probably guessing you get
more or making some kind of Voodoo dance
you can get more results but anyway
probably the Voodoo stuff or the magic
rituals or some chakra meditation can be
more effective if compared to automation
this is my personal opinion ok so
respect to all ... I respect also those who are
making something that I totally disagree
but I at least I gave my opinion and I
hope at least a part of you can agree with me and at the
same time I hope that all the emails that
were talking about automation rather
than manual trading can have at least an
example of one and the others and the
other and
at least figure out what I'm talking
about okay so with this said I don't
want to make it that much long so I hope
you're still there watching the video
that now is ending and as usual I thank
you for watching and subscribing my
channel for the many mails that I
receive ... be patient and of course be
"be something"... because one line of email
where I have to write down and reply for
me doesn't make sense
so I reject that but if someone is
explaining me something or be very
specific or wants to talk to Skype and
there are conditions and in that case I
take in consideration for whatever it
takes for a simple opinion rather than
mentoring or then figuring out what my
tools are and what they are for...
also the respect that I give to you by
doing something here is also something
that I pay respect for the effort that I
made in all the years that I am into
into the "Forex thing" I also beg
you for a bit of respect to my person
or at least in the understanding that it
takes some time to reply to all ... whatever
so thanks again for watching for
subscribing and for supporting my
project and as usual I wish you
good space and time and good life ...
... take care of you okay?...
...BYE!
