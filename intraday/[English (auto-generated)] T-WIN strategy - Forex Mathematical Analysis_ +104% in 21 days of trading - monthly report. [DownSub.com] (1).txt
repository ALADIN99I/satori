hello everybody
and welcome to another uh
episode of my uh
my exposing of what is my performance
and my methodology approaching the
forex using mathematical
approach by using excel
spreadsheets and formulas and
this video is i hope it will be very
short and it's made
for uh answering the continuous
questions that i receive via mail and
unfortunately in this
moment i don't have that much time for
for um occupying myself with this thing
so i hope to give another clarification
showing another um another
month of performance
and just to give an idea of
how my approach to forex is
is going on okay so let's dive into it
immediately and let's grab
first of all if you watch my previous
video and of course i suggest you
strongly suggest you to watch my
previous videos at least
three or four videos back so that you
can have all the sequence of the things
i'm doing and exposing
and in this video i was
[Music]
with this new account demo count that i
have created
at the beginning of the 4th of
november and of course today is the 4th
of december
2020 so
the new demo account for educational
purposes
is going to expire today so it will
close everything today
i have some trades running that i of
course injected after the
non-farm payroll release and other
important news for the day
and this was the beginning of the first
today the fourth and the fifth of
november with this
equity curve that of course is the same
equity curve that
i am reporting here and for
being transparent whatever you can check
in the next statement so this statement
that i will show you in a minute are
about
the end the entire month
of november okay of trading so just to
have an idea that
we are having this account number in all
the
files in fact let me just show you here
it's always the 300 58981
okay three hundred five eight nine eight
one
okay so
we were in this situation
and let me briefly show you what was the
performance
actually
[Music]
till yesterday so these are all the
trades i have
made along this exactly 20 days
and today is the 21st day
so you can always you know stop and
check
by yourself and this is the
equity line of all the trades i've made
with the profit of 102
in 21 20 days of
trading okay and
just to be even more precise
today as i told you i placed
some orders uh about one hour after the
release of the non-farm payroll
which are these orders right here
okay which
i place it at this time of course this
is the
gmt time of mt4 okay
so all the orders are in positive
actually i i'm always trading the gbp
gbp yesterday in the day of yesterday
was in
a cell condition ready to be traded
and today after uh some up and downs and
retracements
due of course to the economic news of
the friday
this is the first friday of the month uh
i waited for a good occasion
for trading still the gbp
in a short direction and
even by analyzing my
[Music]
my excel my excel
spreadsheet with all the formulas i
let me just do a brief recap in a minute
[Music]
i thought that this was a kind of moment
where
after the news the gbp was exhausting
his
his trend up his his his movement
towards uh towards up
and then that it was ready
for for for a
change of direction towards the down
the the downside of course here we see
uh
the whole currencies together from the
beginning of the day
and then we see that all the currencies
related to the gbp and all the
currencies related to the dollar
and in fact here i can see that the
dollar is oscillating
[Music]
but with more opportunities to go
up to express the up direction so
i was waiting for a situation where the
gbp was exhausting
the uptrend for then taking a short
direction
which is this kind of movement where all
the currencies are getting strained
strength against the gbp and if we
see the orders i have here
actually from a starting point
of about 479 480
units of currency currency actually i am
experiencing uh four times
profit okay with just uh one
uh one ordered placer because it's
friday
i want to be cautious i need to finish
early so
basically i took all the currencies
against the gbp
in in short where gbp
is based and in long for gbp as a quote
actually there is still opportunity for
the
gbp to go in the short direction
let me check here let me do just
another update at least
until this area and uh
even if i could make it longer or
whatever
what i am about to do now is just to
create a final
balance and i it's enough
you know for just a bunch of trades
and you don't have to be greedy you
don't have to
think that a trade can last forever
especially in day trading
so basically in order to i will close
all my trades
and get a final balance
for a report let me just grab this
here
okay
so the account is always the same
these are all the trades you can verify
and check yourself
and
and this is the final balance so
52 761
okay which is roughly
103 percent
in a month and if you watch my previous
videos it's
roughly an average that can be taken
constantly by trading with some
methodology and
creating some consistency of course
there were days
where my profit was almost to zero or
just a bit in positive
but i think that this equity line
can can reveal a very good approach
that math can provide
for for uh
for those who are willing to
analyze the market and get
some important information in order to
make a day trading activity okay
so
this is all for now i i told you i will
be very brief even because
my time is pretty limited and i need to
optimize it of course i always
thank you for watching my video
for those who are subscribing my channel
for those who are leaving comments and
the only thing i i can say is that if
you want to
keep in contact with me you can use my
skype connection or
my email despite the fact that some
emails
i'm not about to respond because they
are
too much vague and without any kind of
consistent information and
if you want really to interact with me
you have to put me
something that keeps my attention and
also
you have to have some patience because
in these months i am
very very busy so i cannot give a lot of
time to this
but let's keep in any way in contact
let's try to make this
and i would be happy you know to
have a confrontation with those of you
who are interested in this kind of
interaction
so with all this said i wish you a good
weekend
of course now we are going towards the
weekend
and as usual have a good space
and have a good time enjoy life
bye
