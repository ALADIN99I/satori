hi everybody welcome after
many months that I was not here on
YouTube but of course I had my reasons
basically on working living trading
programming studying and I'm quite usual
to to study for a long time and deep the
markets life conditions and find new
ideas from the previous ones that could
implement the ones that I'm doing and if
you followed my my previous videos of
course you may realize that the engine
that I created to develop a kind of
different understanding of the foreign
currencies movement which is the UFO
algorithm in this webinar in this video
webinar I would like to show another
side of the UFO but this time this isn't
today is the fifth of January 2019 and
so it's the beginning of the year
actually we were between the Saturday
and the Sunday while I'm recording this
so we are the weekend markets are closed
and I would like to do a different kind
of video that anyway can lead you to
inspire you and give you an
understanding both if you're beginner or
expert is always use of
to give a consideration to math base
approach to the forex market because
we're dealing with numbers fractions
whatever their number so their language
is math this is what I am believing day
by day due to my personal research
before starting for beginning who like
briefly to thank the many males that I
received so the many of you that are
writing me emails every day and not
every day or every week I can stand upon
the traffic which is pretty intense and
require me extra effort and if I'm
focused actually I was working in the
last six months to developing something
that I will show you in the next minutes
so if I focus on something that I tend
to avoid also messages that are very
brief and insignificant while I tend to
give a reply or consideration to those
who are saying something okay not just
asking or whatever because there's some
of you that joined the project of the
UFO and after your fall and and thank
can realize this by using also be stool
others don't but they are following the
theory and anyway there's a lot of
things that can be done despite having
UF or not but the point is that there
has to be some kind of improvement in
the things we do so the moment I study
something is just to improve and better
my my Forex experience and trading
experience so then twelve you that are
driving me everyday or contacting me via
skype always if I have time I can give
some time to that but at this moment I'm
very easy so I wanted to use this time
also thank you all and all for all your
comments and if I didn't if it's
possible for me I was following that I
don't have the website that I was
planning to do because trading was even
more interesting and absorbing my energy
so this I am answering to some questions
that I got this month but I think it's
more effective to do a good trading and
anyway the web this year so this is also
a good point of contact where to focus
all the energies so the start whatever
so
normally and let's put a charge wherever
we wanna start from $0 and so you can
have an idea what I'm trying to chart
okay so
that's the template okay so basically
this is the Friday the 4th of time I'm
gonna talk about the 4th of January 2019
markets are closed this time I won't do
any kind of this is more webinar this is
not something to prove what you can see
thousands of videos that I shown with
real live market conditions what math
basic analysis can provide in terms of
selecting the better currencies that
will form the pairs that would be part
of the portfolio that has to be
efficient therefore positive this is by
map based analysis for a positive
performed for a positive trade
performance
because every day there is a development
of the currencies in a way that we have
to understand in different time frames
this is the problem the problem is the
time time is morning they say yeah but
in the horizontal axis time is relative
because we can analyze one minute or one
hour or one day a week and this is very
this is probably more noisy chart is
more nosy death selection of time so we
have to reason in simple blocks and in
fact in the UFO if you've followed my
previous videos all the previous videos
that I made you've noticed that here at
the top now at the moment the markets
are closed so there's no action for that
algorithm but normally you used to see
here serious values of each currency
and then you have more boxes so you have
the chart of the month the week today
four hours one hour half an hour and so
on and with the values compared to that
timeframe okay
then I received some emails were asking
me what the best timeframes to operate
with normally let's take an assumption
that trade be efficient must have a
vision of a day and the day composes the
the Fulop of continuum section because
we have five days in a row where markets
never closed vacation or holidays
excluded
so we need to consider the week the
development of the week at least as a
minimum set up and the day and I also of
course with my tools because within a
moment I will also show you some excel
and this is the part of a different
webinar that I'm doing today
so I also observe other timeframes but I
focus on the daily and weekly ok so you
see numbers that are regarding the
strength or the weakness of the
currencies therefore if we have eight
currencies which are of course
cat Swiss franc TV p OC kiwi and yen
we have to select that one too
stronger and want to week and then pair
them together somehow
this creates an efficient portfolio with
performance major to zero positive this
is what we want to do so a lot of
questions that were coming from you were
regarding the fact that the numbers
right of the screen where somehow I mean
not that much sense this is what I want
to do this evening and also say
something more give a graphical
representation of those numbers with an
idea in mind can really help those who
already have this to the UFO to have a
better understanding of what they're
doing because this is two that I
normally use from time to time and this
is more exclusive because it's the
development of the UFO into an Excel
spreadsheet which can give more
opportunities to make calculations that
metatrader4 doesn't have okay so we know
this year the Eurodollar in the session
of today but I don't want to talk about
your dollar I'm starting from that okay
so
the expert advisors cannot call at this
moment because there are no ticks
an exposition of the values but these
values have been registered into this
spreadsheet what is this
first of all format for understanding
Norman we have the charts we go left to
right in the reading because of the many
sorry because of the many spreadsheets I
have okay there are a lot of splashes
these spreadsheets anyway are recreating
the UFO directly from data that are
exported from an t4 into a folder and
taken as a basic values for calculations
into an Excel spreadsheet we can notice
that in this case the readings are from
right to left
because the first value of the most
recent value what we have here on the
right extreme right because of the
spreadsheet vertical calculation which
places at the top always the first data
we have to read these in the opposite
direction so from right
this sounds like da Vinci method but I
think that the Forex is even more evil
and perverted that for me is fine to
have heard a reading in this case of
currencies so these are the values
normalized on a basal of - of plus 1 and
minus 1 or plus 100 minus 100 doesn't
matter they are all normalized but it's
basically what we see here for example
here we can see this time is this is the
cat the green is the car ok oh sorry
the green is the Aussie okay for example
in this case the day I am observing half
of the day the day the day before and so
when we see the values in the UFO we can
have the weekly and the day okay so
let's trip to the weekly and and I see
that I have this peak so is the Aussie
in the UFO 94 I will see the Aussie with
with the positive value and higher than
any of these ones the gray mystic and
purple is the TV team
Blue is euro red miss Toller you see
black is New Zealand dollar yellow is
who's Frank
take the I forgot oh and brown which is
here
here is the problem
yeah okay I'm sorry this could be a
really big boring but it's important
because the reason why ninety nine
ninety percent of traders are failing is
this is because Forex is this this is
the perpetual motion and oxidation of
the currencies that we have to detect
and select that Forex is this this is
the sort of
graphic explanation of the currencies
and then we just take part of this in
this how can we have an understanding
this is the euro dollar of what it's
going on and if we had select the euro
dollar to trade in the day of Friday
being very success successful at least
unless we had open sell trades in this
area for buying trades in this area
right so if we were somewhere around
here that would have not been such an
efficient
acids to select right
but the problem is and this is why I'm
saying I have to compare the weekly
values and the daily values in the worth
of panel is because
what I see here is the explanation of
the thing so let me consider this I
observe the values in the UFO and I see
that Ozzy is pretty strong
because it has entered this so this is a
very important zone so when a value
breaks and this is trans following
I see that usd/cad since that's
important time if you if if the
beginning of the chart there are four
charts here so let's take the daily
chart and Heath
we just do also this you can better
understand
okay so if this is the beginning then
now and now this data are at nineteen
see up here in the yellow is at nineteen
of that day this is the date of today
that I'm recording but these are the
hours of the server so it's nineteen so
this time here is 19 okay so seven pm of
the server so if I'm here when I see
that do see here at the top is starting
to go up this way here at this point in
time this is why I'm dealing with time
on a daily basis or weekly basis but
this will come after okay I see that
ah see here at this point in time so
what point is this around here okay is
point one one eight okay so these are
the time frame that I exported the data
to achieve this result is five minutes
so
sorry this is this point 100 the 1 1 K 1
1 I boy
let's do 120 around this point take 120
for five minutes is 600 minutes divided
60 minutes is 10 hours okay so 10 hours
ago so if now is 7:00 p.m. okay 10 hours
ago
it's
this 19 minus 10 is Nydia is 9:00 a.m.
okay so at 9:00 a.m. of the server in
the morning I see that Ozzy is starting
to break okay and this is also
reflecting what is occurring in the half
of the vein Alice's but what is more
important is that in the weekly analysis
we see that OC it has broken this level
okay which basically is this
and hopefully because this is the trade
setup of this week so if the traits of
top of the next week will confirm what
I'm seeing now in these time frames what
I'm saying now can be somehow assumed
also for the first days of the next week
to come so from this Monday but there
you have to be confirmed by the numbers
so I see that Ozzy is raising and also
is raising in the day before look at
this bang-bang this this break this
break here was than this break here
confirmation this is trending so we are
the higher number both in the the
algorithm in the UFO in the NT for we
have a great number weekly
in the daily well we find anyway that we
have a positive value this has to be
clear in the day week thinking that we
have to above this so this won't be the
strongest but it has to be positive okay
it has to be positive
this is why I focus also on analyzing
the day before which is not very
possible with
in Metatrader I have to create an extra
algorithm for that it's more easy with
Excel anyway
so confirmed that
it has broken this level because of this
is a specific level that goes above the
100 and starts from 95 or nine point
five or zero point nine five is the same
this is a kind of confirmation that at
least we'll go up to the next level so
if I were but I would have been 9 again
reading these values because this is not
repainting this is what it is
this story historical data calculated I
see also what I see
Yin entering this extreme low level so
extremely negative and also here it
appears and we have to see here this
crosses between yin Swiss franc and
young and you later
but anyway also here even with with some
Peaks
the lowest wall was entering already
entered in the daily okay and this is
just half of the day
here was read already entered so palsy
yen should have been the trade the first
selection then of course keeping in mind
that Aussie yen means Aussie by yet so
what other currencies could have been
paired if we take a look at here
Ozzie by young self means this kind of
event
young is breaking something like
threshold the lower part of the day and
it's also breaking down from a higher
point so selling yen here means because
of this that says so means to break down
so what I'm having this is not yeah like
because this is the weekly let me just
put this interesting what in the weekly
this is not the time frame you are
observing we are observing this moment
in time
and we'll see that here we are having
two near currencies that are showing
some interest
this is you roll this is Swiss franc and
this one that has just started from here
is okay
which have not broken this level but
somehow they have been rejected
take this we see the Swiss franc is more
bastard at this moment but it shows some
kind of support and then it's great okay
so let's say that I would have intend to
use these currencies that have somehow
show some support at this level because
this is these are the levels were words
like support resistance peak head and
shoulder whatever they have since they
don't have sense on the charts because
in the charts we observe we are
observing a ratio not the whole see we
have these peaks of each currency so as
a secondary option for the portfolio
after also yen and by I could select all
so let me to do what normally as usual
let's break this
so we can keep in mind and follow
so we
as strong
or don't
Oh
work
I do apologize for this inconvenience
apparently I cannot write
which it
if I can correct the screen
seems I have double screen
let's see if I can make it somehow
oh it's not work
okay what can we do we can do this
let's write a note here
so we have the weakest
and the strongest
and we have
as we who said to chuck pasta choking
Lucien
and as a stronger we have the palsy and
we have
the other three selections that show
some support at least at that moment on
that level
they show some kind of
to shop in that day so they are
accordingly not the strongest buy
clothes again but they are having they
will have probably a positive powers so
we have Swiss franc
okay
this is bad so this okay so what are the
trades that are coming out from this
combination
well it's very simple ballsy yen
all of them
okay
very simple this is the equation
so at nine o'clock
what can we say also
so this day I'm going to say for example
this hour
we have the cross ocen but we didn't
know at that moment at that moment we
knew only this so at this point we were
also facing yeah
this level here which is this
threshold here was here okay
so he wasn't like in this condition was
a kind of and in fact near more in
detail in the day before there was a
minimum of the swiss franc with a sharp
at least for that day and euro
well you raise this one
so euro was going from negative a
positive situation in negative and
positive and also New Zealand dollar
this is the New Zealand dollar
kind of stationery at this level for
time that was anyway level of support
into peers
so what we have to do now go into our
trading platform and
yeah
Asya
bye-bye
this is the Aussie yen
this is a 15 minutes chart that
around 9:00
so here suppose again
150 beeps up
then we had
Swiss franc yet
wrong nine
says Swiss franc up
throwdown of 10 pips
out of 17 tips
yo yo
round nine
throwdown of 25 pigs that remember trade
combo so that if some something goes
wrong in one of them the other
compensate and this mate makes our stop
loss stop loss doesn't have to be
intended this price level because they
can be kept by this but you have to put
an overall stop loss on your equity
that's the honest applause 2% 1% 3% but
on the enmity of your portfolio anyway
we got 75
then we got New Zealand dollar
this is the day
and nine o'clock
you can see the time
tonight
a
115 beeps
for currencies for currencies
to
for five currencies
four bears traded
with a bit of Throwdown that could have
occur at the moment of the movement of
the euro yen should not that consider
because if we stay straight to the plan
we see only the great reactions and also
we have to we have to understand that we
also have to read these charts as well
but somehow this is the most weak and
this is the most
the ones that are breaking some levels
of extra high and extra no this is the
noise that we've seen the charts okay
and this is pretty confusing at the
beginning but it's very simple because
as I showed you here in the day you can
really see
will you roll
this
it's all
in the day cat the great one
yellow Swiss franc
purple is GT
yeah all of the bottle
and we have the maximum
same thing here
for example yen from the top goes down
so it's really breaking
so if these values are confirmed at the
beginning of the next week and the
scenario stays true to the plan so this
thing I need at least the Monday to
analyze this it's more likely that
things can evolve that's by the fact
that I have to be careful about collapse
or retracement
even if I am suffering some drawdown
because I entered too early
I can always count on the fact that I am
I have identified correctly the trend of
the currency the form of the chorus is
the better express and perform the trend
accordingly to the performance of the
markets which is this stuff notice the
fact that when I reached these values
and I am entering a say nine o'clock
because this was the beginning of the
day at the beginning of the day I was
having only this portion of data and of
course this this this was located here
with all the regression of course at
that moment this was the data
here - here
so Jung was breaking and yam was at the
top on the wheat and the day before was
already falling down so it's multiple
level stuff there are levels and levels
that but we don't take all the Masand in
the middle at the moment we take only
one to and from a further analysis that
despite the fact that comes from an
analysis of the currencies and because
of this it's both technical and
fundamental because technical analysis
relies explicitly only on charts
this kind of technical analysis it's the
technical analysis that becomes
fundamental
we can observe that there are some
beings that are necessary to do to
create confusion and indecision
but we really pick up things that are
making nikyo yen even if it made a
positive with a bit of a tradesman at
five at 17 so 5:00 p.m.
while the Swiss franc also at 5:00 p.m.
it was having this the Aussie yen at
5:00 p.m.
look at 5:00 p.m. it is completely after
so at that moment it wasn't there was
helping to compensate and the Aussie yen
was also going up
so at the end by entering at that moment
with those bears only so four tears to
trade
I was basically having a straight line
up
just because I consider the numbers that
are in the UFO that here you can have a
presentation from right to left and have
an idea of what this those numbers are
okay so what to expect for the next week
honestly I don't know honestly I would
trust my numbers the moment I see that
okay
of course this is a mental approach it's
like
an algorithm a robot there are some
certain things no matter what because we
have two days of darkness that by my
experience let me say next week what is
going to happen what I demonstrated you
here now and explained was anyway what
to effectively select for a trade after
Friday morning
these are values that are high and low
of a certain currencies that are the
same levels in the you
and what would have been the experience
of about four or five hundred peeps
global with only four pairs majority of
time in positive
that's very simple if the scenario is
the same on Monday Monday Tuesday then I
could say that this is a good and amend
that if you watch the video again and
maybe you consider the way I have you of
course I know I'm closing now this video
because it's about the hour that I was
intended to do this but what are the
suggestions at the end of this
focus on certain parts of the video if
you like you can always go back and you
can also check with your Metatrader
the charts that I'm showing you now that
I've shown you in this video and see if
the data are genuine are the same that
you are having in your trading
environment
what you see now here is a kind of
radiography okay x-ray of the currencies
that you can analyze you can go back
into the unit and see where are
this lines like if you were watching the
end to a forum and this is for all of
you so it's just an analysis that can
give you a suggestion for making your
analysis this is not a suggestion to
trade because trade is very personal and
someone has a different kind of attitude
to risk compared to another world so
this is just intended for a market
analysis of course we don't do market
analysis for itself we do that for
developing a trading plan a trading
action so if this data may be coherent
and it can be another kind of
confirmation to your analysis analysis
of the markets well then you have at
least another point of view
technique or strategy whatever you have
so program will do other webinars I
don't know but there were a lot of
fragmentary questions in the emails and
a lot of people that wants to speak I
can have more time in the future at this
moment I wanted to develop all this
stuff and have a better understanding
from any point so that I could have made
also video that can be somehow more
graphical and make understand things
that only number I see those this stuff
I see in my brain
the moment I see numbers but it took me
a while to make figure it out how the
things should have been and and this is
the result which lets my knowledge very
analysis on the Forex so
thank you very much for your patient and
interest in following along this body
now of course you may have probably
questions but I suggest you to watch the
video at least a couple of times because
despite the fact that it seemed very
simple to select the top there are there
there is a lot of information that I
have released right now
so if you have questions it's good to
receive some emails or comments would be
more appreciable some comments so in
that case they can be like a question
for an answer for a lot of similar
questions and for all the other stuff
like if you want to communicate if you
see that there is an opportunity or not
to enter in this project you can contact
me privately I will of course make a
selection so if you write just hey hi
how much is dea it's not that's not the
purpose of the thing so ok so I will
consider only those who are writing with
some sense and its own meaning and not
that they have to say that I'm good or
whatever this is not what it's about but
it's about talking like a trader or
someone that has experience and doesn't
have to be positive or negative but has
to be conscious this is very important
because this is not an automated trade
this is better than an automated trade
for me
because it shows me it makes all the the
automation of the computations which is
13 3-0 spreadsheets before arriving to
this one
so it's ready enough
with this I don't need automation I need
to be in the morning at nine o'clock
at nine o clock here
but zero point three zero zero point
zero three zero point zero five up for
deals yen and realize 150 bits
okay
so
for me for my vision and automation can
to do the something like this can be
done it's very exhausting but I still
prefer this way because I can do
fundamental analysis as well on the real
behavior of the currencies and then
arrive to the pears as I always
explained as you saw before so I hope
that this the content of this video
found you well and if you're still awake
I thank you for watching for subscribing
the channel
some months ago I arrived to a thousand
members so it's important
or the recognition for myself which
means that it's what I'm doing as some
sense so if you want to be posted for
further videos you can always subscribe
and I thank you for that then thanks for
your comments and you show since a while
have a good space
