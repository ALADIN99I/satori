hi everybody and welcome to this third
part of the video that was
the whole situation of the real trading
example
that I decided to do for you in order to
explain or to have a vision what is the
way sometimes we can trade it depends
always on the setup of the markets
after the second video I was very tired
and went to bed some hours of course it
was night and I had some to recover some
some hours of sleeping even because I
needed to the flu so I woke up this
morning right
half an hour ago now it's 9 o'clock is
Friday and
let's see
what our
results are in regards to the algorithm
as usual I said that I wanted to show
you also what these values are in
terms of
graphical representation and
actually if you
take a look to the previous videos you
see that
what I was
studying about the behavior of
horizon GDP against
falling other currencies that was was
what happened at a certain point GBP
tended to
fall a bit until they found
support on these currencies and
then it began anew
to hit a new high
so a new condition of rising and
other currencies are now behaving in
South even if I've notice at the first
time this is a trade of
10 hours and not 10 hours because as you
can see here the values of the time it's
20 minutes from midnight okay and now we
are at 10:30 so sadly 10 hours and
[Music]
today I think we're gonna do other
things so I will also close the
positions to show you
some considerations I
diversified my risk on all three CAD
young and New Zealand dollar and as you
may notice I
was right to double the palsy and
the end I should have done also with the
tad
less lucky was the New Zealand dollar
that of course in weekly was anyway not
that week so I took it as a bit of risk
and in fact this is the first
trade that I closed
also I can take a position of
the Australian dollar and
a position of GBP
okay so let's do our first
it's a report
and this is it
okay with three trades
same account of course ours can be nine
or tiny depends on the hour of the
server
the account still the same we got a
starting situation like this and went to
300 400 then it went down if you
remember 293 writing the during the
night it reaches again the minus 300
that I was initially in way paying with
this situation of the highest price okay
so the price would face it actually wait
another moment to to trade more in
advance but I wanted to start and then
have
an ending
proportional to give some time to the to
the trade to breath
here we see that
GBP New Zealand dollar was the currency
that we trace of the most
but
the currency pair was and way helped by
the fact that other currency pairs like
to beat an
Aussie and most of all
were
reacting compensating okay solar cell
pointing just in one because was not
this the case to trade this way I have
diversified my rich and again as you can
see this is the graphical representation
that in certain cases means
retracement in other case means it's
friendly here for example there was this
level of
signal with this big retrace that went
to hit
the overlapping with the London session
that just started
an hour ago and
but then there was this final
eight half of GDP yen and
to be be Australian dollar same in this
part and then quite
stable and GBP cab
see here was a final
spike to reach the height then go down
and reach this area this yellow area
here that you see and
focused
the buyers power here in deciding this
price level and then go up
so
uncontrol knows also dispositions
and
make the final account
report
okay
so in just
10 hours with six straight
and with this values that usually you
always can
verify
this was the result
very clean very simple on Friday and
it's quite enough for a day
this is why
sometimes I I do stop the trades is just
to show that we have to take out
the profit and not leave it there
because
brokers and
institutions they have their own
algorithms for
for
[Music]
reading the positions of every trade I
already handled my personal trade
account but here was for your
example
so this is the very same value and
what has to say and of course this was
the
graphical representation that allowed me
to read see here we have the yen that
it's falling at this moment but
this way then probably will fool more I
don't know all right for me it's enough
because when I'm not trading all the
Japanese yen I'm also trading in
Japanese yen against something else so
it's the whole situation that
we have to visualize and understand
anyway with this graphical
representation you may have more idea of
what you are reading here
real time value stick by tape they are
telling me that GDP went in stronger
now is 1400 and
gauzy Swiss franc I should have tried
Swiss mark and
let's see just it was my
thinking about
not trading Swiss franc but I in this
case I should have tried that
okay you don't want me to know the chart
okay strange behavior
it's wrong because I had more more
platforms open and let the computer run
for a long time so cope with the memory
it's almost exhausted anyway even Swiss
franc
even in the daily you see it's quite
negative and if we also see
the situation this is Swiss franc the
gray
we see that there could have been a good
trade also for this
okay this completes as a final recap so
I will not make it that long
the information
that I usually
share with you in regards to how to use
these dis algorithm and I hope that
the many questions that I have I am
receiving constantly every day
have a
comprehensive answer on
the major
topics that are occurring this kind of
trading and
I'm happy also to show you that
this module
graphical module is giving some
important information
correct information about the channeling
of the price in relation to the fair
price of the instrument
so all the say we should put end of the
week
good for me a good recover from flute
and
thanks for watching
these two videos
writing and subscribing on my channel as
usual I am available for

final results a
