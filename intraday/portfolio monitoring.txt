so what I said to my main page is that I

so what I said to my main page is that I
want to buy dollar and sell all the

want to buy dollar and sell all the

want to buy dollar and sell all the
other





currencies how do I obtain

this these curves are identical are the

this these curves are identical are the

this these curves are identical are the
same right exactly the





same basically from the formula that

same basically from the formula that
provides me the the UFO market





performance which is good for me on for

performance which is good for me on for
certain kinds of analysis in conjunction

certain kinds of analysis in conjunction

certain kinds of analysis in conjunction
with other









performance which basically has this

formula





okay the formula is that I

okay the formula is that I
take





wait maybe a little bit bigger can be

more clear









so I'm

so I'm
saying take the DJ column value which is

every time I buy or sell an

every time I buy or sell an

every time I buy or sell an
asset and this is an

beginning of my journey in this channel

beginning of my journey in this channel

beginning of my journey in this channel
we need to put everything under an

we need to put everything under an

we need to put everything under an
equation and when we put

orders like buying or selling some

orders like buying or selling some

orders like buying or selling some
crosses or other

crosses or other

crosses or other
crosses we basically write an equation

crosses we basically write an equation

crosses we basically write an equation
that in our case in order to be profit

that in our case in order to be profit

that in our case in order to be profit
profitable we would like that that

profitable we would like that that

profitable we would like that that
equation is Major to zero right okay





so if we are let me get rid of this if

so if we are let me get rid of this if
we are for example

we are for example

we are for example
deciding just to





buy

buy
dollar and sell Euro and we have have

dollar and sell Euro and we have have

dollar and sell Euro and we have have
this kind of

this kind of

this kind of
curve and we find this curve Chang it

curve and we find this curve Chang it

curve and we find this curve Chang it
here as

here as

here as
well in order to obtain that guess





what pardon but I need to arrange in

what pardon but I need to arrange in
order for you to have a better view okay

order for you to have a better view okay

order for you to have a better view okay
what I will do this in this case I will

what I will do this in this case I will

what I will do this in this case I will
just simply

just simply

just simply
create a

create a

create a
formula on which I buy dollar and sell

formula on which I buy dollar and sell

formula on which I buy dollar and sell
Euro and if I then make a propagation of

Euro and if I then make a propagation of

Euro and if I then make a propagation of
the formula I obtain the

the formula I obtain the

the formula I obtain the
same

same

same
curve okay so what if I am doing this

curve okay so what if I am doing this

curve okay so what if I am doing this
operation here I am getting a profit but

operation here I am getting a profit but

operation here I am getting a profit but
the moment I see that this profit starts

the moment I see that this profit starts

the moment I see that this profit starts
to

to

to
go in the opposite sense so

go in the opposite sense so

go in the opposite sense so
negative I know that this operation

negative I know that this operation

negative I know that this operation
so which is





basically

basically
plus USD minus





Euro it's an equation that goes negative

Euro it's an equation that goes negative
and My Equity goes negative okay
