hi everybody and
welcome to this
new video
tutorial an example on how to analyze
the market
trying to get
currency strength or weakness
in order to decide what currency pairs
tray and this
this very moment since I'm having anyway
a trade in inaction
before starting to analyze this trade
with this type of kind of
video for us regarding the setup of the
markets that had already a little bit
change in the setup and we'll see in a
moment
and before starting to analyze this I
would like to
take a look to
the previous week which was the end of
November and the beginning of December
so
this very morning around one o'clock
when I closed the trades of the previous
week so what I'm showing you here is the
trade of the previous week while I'm
still working on a graphical module if
you see my previous videos you will see
something about this
so in this three statements you will see
the development of the analysis that I
made this wheat and
swing trading that I took since one
o'clock in the morning of
this very week now we are the first week
of December and
there was a new reading of the markets
with the new analysis but just to recap
the previous week I
started
almost at the end of November as you can
see by this
information reported in the statement
and I traded to be deterred in by quite
successfully and
implementing also with some oszi against
GBP because of the reading of the setup
even if it was minor compared to the tab
in the GBP and
to finish by trading again leaving the
trades open in the weekend and
closing them with
this final balance
so doubling
the the original balance of the account
and I also had some negative trades and
there was a kind of a certainly at a
certain point but by the reading of the
markets it was quite
stable the values the world quite stable
the values of certain currency pairs as
you can see they exchanged it completely
so I was trading buying cab euro and GBP
and some yen and
at the very first hour of the Monday now
it's Monday evening so this morning
morning before going to bed I was
observing the markets and they finally
realized that
final spike that allowed me to close the
trade successfully and realizing and
doubling the balance with this result
and
after this I started a new prey to some
hour ago
the new account always starting with the
same balance so it's always the same
procedure too at the certain point we
have to close the trades and get the
profit and we have to accumulate not
only leaving the money to our brokers or
in the market
so I started by
analyzing the currency pairs and there
was these
values that now ever be changed okay of
GBP always invariant upon his yen which
is a kind of confirmation of the
previous week but then if we analyze
what it's going on at this moment
in the currency pair to be beat up on
his yen and especially in a daily
situation we may notice that GBP that
was quite strong now is getting somehow
wheat and
also Japanese yen is getting strong
situation that was not this way since
the morning the morning and in the
afternoon
GBP was the strongest currency pair even
if it is now still the strongest that it
was about 350 value and Japanese yen was
negative therefore I focused myself on
trading GBP Japanese yen and
at what point I trade well when I
analyzed the markets I was around this
area
so I had to wait because there was
already a big move of dawn okay this is
quite clear there is already a big move
and as we may see
it occur to change the direction the
overlapping between the London session
and the American session the more if we
observe on a larger timeframe
we may notice that there was a gap at
the beginning of the day
basically I closed my the trades of the
previous week around this area at the
beginning of the urgent session and
so I decided to position my trades
around this this area
fine to get another flux up of the
currency pairs but as we may notice now
we have a GBP completely negative
probably the most negative of the
currency pairs and Japanese yen
somehow strong okay so
in this case
there is a kind of
transposition of the negative values we
observe for example in a daily timeframe
even if we have Japanese yen
GBP Japanese yen we may notice that the
shift went from Japanese yen negative to
Japanese yen positive and New Zealand
dollar started to guaran week
so actually now we should observe
GBP incident all our operators also
Swiss franc but Swiss franc is very
narrow in the
in the observation so I
very rarely
taking consideration Swiss franc
anyway that will serve on a narrow ad
timing timeframe
this is the actual situation of the
currencies and I'm already in profit
even with this
trades that I took exactly at the fall
of the price that
well exactly
to cover the gap of this morning
so the price went up
floating in this area leaving this area
completely
alone and then
went up once then retrace it went down
twice and then had a big move down
till this this area were a lot of buyers
were ready to buy and then there was
this movement up again so that was the
only
little
movement that I could have got as the
values in the daily
are not confirmed anymore even if
Japanese yen is solid GBP is carrying
values around 300 it was
350 375 something like that and Japanese
yen was negative now Japanese yen is
positive and
somehow is
scaring a strain that was starting to
worry me so instead of keeping the the
trades
to much longer unless there are some
events that can show me that Japanese
yen is getting weak again I
could also say well I took enough profit
because if we take a snapshot of the
statement of this very first trade and
now we close also the other trades at
least two of them
so that we can see the performance
of this very first week of
December
okay
this was
some
one hour ago
and
exactly now I just made this profit
now it took only one
position opened the very most profitable
position waiting for something to happen
that probably won't I don't know because
markets with this kind of moves are very
unrealistic and difficult to read it
especially you would stick only to one
single chart and
I prefer to keep in mind that there was
this GBP Japanese yen since the previous
week McNeil's
see how it developed and
now we are having this very wide
movement and probably there will be
still moving up but we have to
accumulate profit and then reposition
ourselves if it's possible on a better
position and we have to taking
considerations there are other currency
pairs that are
available to be traded and
to be substituting our
actual
currency that we are training so as this
is just for example
one
proposed to explain and the values and
the visualization of what we are looking
here
the only thing that I can say is that by
also closing this trade and making a
final
account history for today
okay
with only eight trades
we just got this
this profit
now the markets are in
a great uncertainty and
there are probably other other
currencies that we may observe let me
check in the daily we are we are having
for example GBP New Zealand dollar I
would like to open that
works
okay
this isn't one hour let's put it suppose
to this because oxidation and they are
all
ranging
exchanging and they are trading
continuously Japanese yen New Zealand
dollar Australian dollar so the
movements are not very clear and this
this distinct
let's also apply
young corrido
we will take a moment to make
computations
now it's all 0 of course at the
beginning and then is making
okay
and see here one and thirty minutes we
have Japanese we have GBP
negative in Japanese yen
strong
at 30 minutes
if we go on a
higher time frame we have GBP strong
it's a panacea it's strong and stronger
than before
so this is uncertainty and should stay
away from from the trade the important
thing is that we have just realised
anyway some profit and maybe we can wait
for the next move at the beginning of
the next day now we are in the
American session and
some big movements has already been
performant okay so
why to rushed in a trade when if we
would have been before
ok but if something already happened is
not that important or that
necessary to
get into a trade if it's not the proper
moment or if we don't have reached the
proper level of
to position ourselves
taking a long position or a short
position
the more I
am working on this graphical model that
still requires some
adjustments in the formulas in order to
be we are quite close to the point but I
really like to give some of my energies
to
make it even better
and more precise
much precise as possible
[Music]
for this reason I
cannot be always on trading or always on
mentoring so at this point
the important thing is that I have
realized enough profit in some hours
because as you may notice
this occurred just
one hour ago
okay
two hours ago
to see this hour here and
that's quite enough and also to get a
good position but we are now having this
area that
probably there are still some positions
that are waiting to be heated some price
levels and I don't want to whisk and go
for her I will let the market work and
maybe reveal me a confirmation of
on a
higher time frame because today is the
Monday so is the Monday and it's also
the beginning of
the week
so if we compare the daily
and
the weekly
values are the same
with the beginning of Tuesday
we will have
some values in the weekly and
other values in the daily that can may
confirm the trend of the week or suggest
that other currencies are taking
position on that that's why they would
say be careful on trading on Monday and
on Friday
as usual I invite you to watch my
previous videos for more information
about the reading of the market through
this module and
for
any request or suggestion or further
information you may want to have there's
always the email or Skype to contact me
so thanks for watching
for supporting and for all your
questions and/or your attention and
focus and also the suggestions for maybe
improving some some features in my
algorithm and
as usual have a good time and space
