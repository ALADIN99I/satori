hello
fellow traders welcome back for a
kind of recap an extension of my
previous video
which of course
injected a lot of responses but by
comments and following and emails
still i have to check on my skype
because time
as i said is very limited
but somehow i thought as i have a bit of
time
today which is saturday the 14th
of november so markets are closed as you
can see also from my
trading platform which is still
i decided to give extra information
uh which i think is a good thing even
for having a
prosecution and
[Music]
an extra confirmation of the things i'm
doing by using
math in my approach to the forex
analysis therefore the forex trading
so also i will try to be very
short brief and somehow
providing some extra information
so let's go directly to the point
straight up
probably uh as you can remember from my
previous video
and any in any case if you didn't see
that
i strongly suggest first of all to watch
the produce one which basically
is this one
on which i
shown some performances of a month of
trading which in real then
was not exactly 30 days of trading was
less
and i was briefly speaking about this in
terms of
results and performances
if you remember i i got i had
shown this previous uh statement
which was anyway taken in in the
in the space of of a month
which basically is this
okay with all the trades then of course
you can
stop post your video and then check by
yourself
so basically we got this which is
exactly the same
then of course i started you know as a
prosecution because it was
as usual i do demo for my videos for
educational proposals
use a demo account which replicates my
trades
but anyway gives anyway the idea of the
performance of my analysis
and also let's see if we find yeah
and this was the starting of the new
account for the next month
which had this performance in the very
two days of of trading
which basically is this
right
so we were at this point so i hope that
this
is our starting point from today
so what to say
[Music]
basically this was the original trades
uh starting from the fourth
of november 2020
and was for the days the fourth and the
fifth so two days of trading
by having this performance with this
result
meantime one week has passed because now
we are at the
14th of november
so and it's friday so
let's say until the 13th to
30th of november and
the results up to
now from this point that i've left
you with with this analysis
so again the fourth the fifth
and then prosecuting
i traded then the 10th
of november putting multiple trades that
i will explain in a while
because i was a little bit
early in some trades so i added some
positions
the 11th the 12th
and the 13th okay so we got
these days extra and the performance
arrived to this result which is also
the one that i can show you so we have
16
a
and off of uh
of profit which results in a
total amount of sixty six
thousand eighty eight seven hundred
point eighty which is exactly
sixty six thousand eighty eight 700
and 0.80 okay so
this is actually what i'm doing so
i will keep this statement
to make some extra considerations
and arrive at certain points because
trading is not always an exact science
sometimes you
do things that are perfectly right you
enter at the perfect moment because also
you have
time to be in time
for for trading sometimes you're too
late sometimes you're too early
sometimes you are
getting the move that that has already
finished but if you are capable of
reading
[Music]
exactly the the markets
and the situation goes against you
which means a negative instead of a
profit
positive profit then you can always
adjust your trades in order to create
a kind of compensation
compensate and closing with a very small
profit
it's always definitely better than
closing with a loss right so
this can be the compromise
in order to maintain a stability
and a consistency in in getting results
in trading
so profits
must be as higher as possible and losses
must be reduced to a zero
for what is possible is not possible a
hundred percent especially on a large
scale of trades
and a large scale of events
economic events that occur every day
and but we need to keep the losses
close to zero or at least with a very
small profit
which is anyway even more sustainable
for as regard
for as regards the psychology in trading
for
the day and the day after okay
so let's start from some assumptions
because this is uh
the new statement that i'm that i'm
bringing up day by day so just to keep
an
update and of course if i have time i'm
doing
i will do more videos depending on the
time available
during the week it was not possible so i
decided to make something
today which is which is saturday
because i had some some time for doing
that to do that
okay so let's just have a brief recap
now even if you see my face which is not
i'm still here okay so
let's grab some considerations okay
first so
from the statements that i've shown you
let me just arrange something
okay so
we got let me just do this
okay so in the first
[Music]
the first uh account
which was one month okay
and you can go and check by by
by watching the video posing that and
see all the trades
in real i traded for
exactly 19 days
okay of trading
follow my concept
[Music]
starting with the base of 50 000
units of currency
the gain was 33
and 300 and something
okay
this in result is a plus
66 as i said as i stated
in 19 days
okay now we have the second
uh then i will show you that again okay
it's just to have a recap
to for those who were asking me the
performances
in the long term and of course with the
compounding effect you can then do the
math by yourselves
on the second
account which is the prosecution so the
day after
uh the the effective days of trading
that i was that were available for me to
be done
were six
okay
always starting with 50
000 units of currency which was
basically the same as
here so let's say that
i would i could have been also start
starting with
this amount together you know that
the accounts have one month of
major of brokers give them with one
month of
of life so
just to prosecute i got anyway
i got anyway for six days of trading
roughly uh was 16
887
plus dot something
on a base of 50
000 this was
another extra gain of plus
uh 33 percent
okay in six days this time
the other in 19 days
if i had a prosecution from this account
to without having the
the noise of of redoing an account
anyway i would have made
this amount of profit plus
this amount of profit starting with
50 000 okay
so by doing the math till now
by starting with the 50 000 units
of of of trading
the the effective gain in
19 plus six in
so 20 yes
25 days
of effective trading words
33 and 324
plus
1687 was
plus 50
000. and two hundred and twelve
you do the match yourself to see if i'm
doing wrong
okay plus something i think it was
80 here plus 80.
so now it was uh 20 20 22
and this was a thing
so roughly it was this
this result which is
100
plus in 25 days okay
so because you compound of course
so this was the this is the results
starting and trading and in 25 days
okay so
performances over time
have to be compounded and
imagine if you are doing the same and
the same in the same
month after month
what this
performance of profit can be
and consider that in this
i got some winning trades
and some losing trades
okay so
there was also some negative results but
in the overall balance
especially when you trade a specific
currency because that
example was taken trading the the
british pound um there could be then not
all the pairs are going
in the same direction or with the same
kind of
uh force
okay and some of them can also be
negative
but if you trade seven pairs
and five of them are more than positive
and two of them
are negative with a minor
grade because you are anyway
detecting and trading the right
direction for that
for that
for that day or for those hours in the
day
the result is anyway
more than positive okay
so in regards to this
because also i got a request in regards
to the
losing trades or whatever let me just
do some kind of
statement so what is a wrong trade
let's write this way what
is a wrong
trade at least this
is what i can say from my experience
okay
so a wrong trade could be
when you make an analysis and you
detect the wrong direction
of an asset
okay but
something can go wrong
which doesn't mean you are detecting
something wrong but something can go
wrong
because you enter the trades
too early
sorry for writing not very well too
early
or entering something
entering a trade too late
or to enter
long
at a high or enter
short
at a low price
okay this could be
something that i i hope makes you think
uh in terms of
uh improving
the way you're trading by asking
yourself these questions and
trying to find a way to to
improve them okay so major of time if
you're not successful or whatever ask
yourself
did i detect the wrong direction did i
made a good a good analysis but i
entered
too early or too late which basically
could basically could mean also
entering a long or a short position
at a high or a low price okay
so these are the conditions and we are
all
uh subjects of these possible
issues in our day trading especially in
manual trading
okay so no one accepted can encounter
these
difficulties do you agree with me
so anyway
no mistakes are irreversible
there's always a possible solution
because
if i understand
that something is going
wrong and i am capable
let's say i enter too early okay so
let's say i detect
that a currency i'm i'm always thinking
in terms of currency okay so
for example when i traded
the gbp
i want to be sure that you get that i am
trading
euro gbp
i'm trading gbp
usd cad
oz ncd
chf and jpy
which are one two three four five
six and seven okay and they are always
gbp
okay so when i'm trading gbp and
in my charting
on my excel i have a line of
gbp which of course normally you read it
in this direction but now for
this educational purposes i will read i
will do this from
left to right as a normal asset
this gbp in this case anyway currency
and not pair
is the result of all this together
okay so let's say that
my currency is moving in this direction
and
by my analysis i detect
that this is the right direction
okay so i go long
and i enter a trade at this level
price goes up a bit and then has a
retracement probably because
i'm too early and i'm starting this
before for example the london session
and maybe there is a retracement like of
30 pips
even okay in the overall
total so
if i know that by
the continuous reading uh
this anyway is the right direction
and i have more
more intuition and confirmation
of being right despite the drawdown
that i am suffering i can always think
of reinforcing
this position at specific levels so
split
instead of trading i don't know
a certain amount of lot size
splitting that in
0.3 for example 0.3
and 0.3 which also gives me the
opportunity
the moment a currency goes in the right
direction
to take profit of two thirds
of my trade
and leave another third for
further market movements okay so this
provides me also this opportunity
but if i am for example in the sense
that
i start to detect that something is
going wrong
and then it starts to retrace
and at a certain point from my reading
i i realized that the main direction
because of some eco macroeconomic events
exogenous events it's now short
because market can change there's
nothing that can be
certain a hundred percent well then even
in that case
uh
because i had detected a wrong direction
okay which is similar to the case of
being too late
because for example i get the whole
movement
big movement and i enter long here
and then the price starts to go in the
opposite direction
so is is this the case why this one was
this one okay
so which is basically in other terms
buying high or selling low
in this case is a buy high
well of course despite some loss that i
am
experiencing i can always by
re-considering all the analysis
to set a proper amount
of lot sizes that allow me
first of all to recover the loss and
get the loss to zero and then take the
rest
as a positive profit
even if by doing this
it requires an extra amount of work
which i have to be available to do
in order to maintain stability
in my trading okay so
so
what we see in this case
now let me switch to another color
there were days
just to take the last uh
statement okay there were days where the
majority of my trade
my trade sorry let me just
also do this
made
um a trend line
right up which means i was
perfectly right and in time
with with
with my analysis and also
buying or selling at the proper price
level
other days like this
okay
i could have been much late
entering the trades not a very good
price level
but having the opportunity anyway to
rather than having some
margin here having just a little
profit
but if i didn't do some
extra work on this
so if i wouldn't have not adjusted with
extra trades
in order to compensate and re-read the
charts in order
to accord to the market performance this
one
instead of being very narrow but
up lying would have been
something that was going down okay do
you agree with me
then in this
third scenario and even in this
fourth
okay
there was uh a hundred percent
or almost a hundred percent of right
direction and a good
time good timing in entering the trade
which means not the good time but the
good
with the good time equals to a good
price level it's a bit of contradiction
contradictory but it is what it is okay
so we do not don't do not have to expect
uh that every day
is the same even because
you know especially in these times with
all the pandemics
with a new president of united states
with a stock market that
has you know very
alternate performances and
the monetary policy of specific
countries especially
the dollar um we cannot expect to
predict
everything we can expect for sure we
have to
search anyway the right reading
of the day and
make uh make a deal with it okay
so if even if there is a day or two
where i could have anyway had a loss
for me it's better to get a
a very small profit
okay which is fine it's a good deal
for me it's very
[Music]
encouraging and psychologically
something that hurts me in a positive
sense
the fact of any way closing with some
profit
even if it's not that much and i think
that this kind of situation where
some errors can be
can be done in the evaluation of the
market
are anyway uh
not that much important the moment
you understand how to solve them
okay so how to compensate a loss and
create a profitable position from a loss
from a losing position okay so i hope
that this
can be clear uh in terms of what
we can do by
approaching our trade and our
analysis
based on this kind of charting
this kind of math and the math applied
that shows us for example how the gbp
this is the this is the charting of
friday
okay for as regard the gbp the dollar
so gpp based dollar based and
all the currencies together some days
are more clear
the friday it's more heavy even
the monday or the first day of the month
or the
first friday of the month which when we
have also some
news like the non-farm payrolls and
stuff like that
so there are situations where the
markets are more difficult to be read
and other days where the markets are
more easy to be right
there are days where we have great
oscillations where the price at the end
of the day
doesn't move that much from the
beginning of the day
and other days where we have trending
conditions of course we would like to
have all the days are trending but
this is not the reality so we
need to adapt and in order to adapt
we need to be
very adaptive yeah
so just to recap also for
answering to
to the questions and the observation i
got
[Music]
let me just
so to improve
trading
first of all we need to have uh
we need to be adaptive
they by day
we need to be
observers
okay to we need to observe
i mean would be like observe
and report
we need to have
let's say a stable
mathematical
model
that recreates the market performance
okay we need to have some rules
and follow them
and these rules are
related to the analysis
and to the money
and risk
management
okay
so to develop a strategy that works
we don't have to do much things you know
we have to develop our
mathematical model observe it
observation it's really important
i i got you know i had to confront
myself with a lot of traders
that are trading just by following some
videos with indicators with support
resistance but without
making their own
paying their own duty of
observing everyday the market a lot of
people read a lot of books
but when it takes when it's time to read
the book of the chart of the charting
which is the most and first
source of information in the forex
they don't even read a chart for five
minutes
i can actually assure you that
i read
the market day by day
even by getting experience
like if it was the first day
sometimes eight hours a day and
this doesn't mean you have to stay then
eight hours to trade every day
but it means that if you want to learn
and observe
and observe the dynamics that are
related especially in this approach
that that consider currencies
rather than pairs the observation
must be very accurate and
taken on on a large scale
until you reach a point that you can
be capable of developing a math model
a model based on math okay
because we're dealing with numbers as i
always said
and the language of the numbers is math
so i would not suggest any other
thing different from math and this is of
course my approach i'm not saying that
this is
this is the only approach in fact there
are many successful traders that are not
following this
this this approach to the forex analysis
and but this is good in my opinion
for forex math
is less applicable in the same in the
the kind of mat i'm using is less
applicable for example to the market of
the commodities or to the stock market
because
in that case uh we have a completely
different
marketplace
it's a centralized market it's not an
over the counter market
like forex so we have different rules
but in forex there is this
peculiarity of dealing with
assets which are the pairs that are just
fractions
of an entire
of an entire number that defines
the currencies so as said gbp
or any other currency is the result of
euro gbp
gbp usd gbp cad all the ncb
chf and jpy okay
so for those who are willing to have
this approach
anyway they have to remember these
points as well
and when you have to follow your rules
you have to keep them following and when
you
go wrong in something you have to
analyze them
and think about if you didn't follow the
rule
or if you follow it but there's
something in the ruling that you have to
uh rather than adapt correct
okay this is a process that can take
years
but it's important to follow the steps
in order to be consistent
consistency in profit means consistency
in the approach okay
so after this
i can i can what else i can say
if not to
thank you for
for watching this video for
the comments you're always writing
and for the subscribing of this channel
and of course i really suggest you
if you didn't see that before to watch
also
the produce video which this one is a
kind of
prosecution and as usual
i wish you a good space
and a good time
bye
