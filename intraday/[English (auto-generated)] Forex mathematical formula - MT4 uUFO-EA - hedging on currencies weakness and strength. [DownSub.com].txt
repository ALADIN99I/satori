hi everybody and welcome to this new
video tutorial
attempting to give another example on
how to analyze the markets
in this third week of
December
today is Wednesday and
let's go straight for to our
situation
I have an initial report
to show because on Monday I was
completely missing an opportunity with
New Zealand dollar against other
currencies New Zealand dollar was that
is strong and
big move has already happened in the
very first hours of the morning so I
decided to put songs and buy limits that
were not hit and also this is why I had
this
standing orders that that I decided to
cancel because
they were already gone and
on Tuesday anyway it happened this is a
balancer town made for the example as
usual as I do always in my videos and
what happened on Tuesday
is that another currency came out quite
strong while New Zealand dollar was
retracing and now New Zealand dollar is
getting
has become strong again
against Australia which was
Australian dollar so I decided on
Tuesday morning the 12th as you can see
here to compare the values analyzed on a
daily basis and on a weekly basis as
well
about
how to hedge
Australian dollar which was strong
against some characters that appear at
wind
even if I was not a much confident I
decided also to trade against Swiss
franc as you can see here
Japanese yen that was quite Upton and in
fact these are the ones with lowest
values let's also do this
and
undoubtedly there was a correlation to
be traded with palm and with Canadian
dollar
so it's also swing trading situation you
may notice your swap condition and
now we are at the point as you may
notice on weekly basis that Australian
dollar and New Zealand dollar are quite
strong the same and there is this battle
between the two of them against
GBP Swiss franc and CAD
quite negative and
Japanese yen a new robot normally euro
and dollar at this moment I'm not
focusing that much the more on other
crosses so what I decided to do as I was
saying on
Tuesday morning to inject some trades
to hedge in this case so to lower the
risk by
differentiating
financial instruments and trading
Australian dollar as strong New Zealand
dollar was retracing so in that case
there was a kind of
change of element in the market set up
and
now they're quite
similar on a weekly basis but in a daily
as we may notice New Zealand dollar has
got has got more strength than
Australian dollars so I'm almost about
to close the Straits now and
so let's do this
because I got enough profit from
more than one day of trading and let's
do again another detailed report
okay so as usual by
analyzing the markets very quickly
on a longer on the longer time frames
I mean monthly weekly and daily
and also focusing sometimes on the four
hours chart
if we notice a kind of coherence
on the values of the currencies there
can be the opportunity
evaluate only few charts
above the 28 charts that we normally can
trade and therefore we have to observe
first
as usual some of you made me notice that
I don't put stop losses I
have developed this kind of
way to analyze the markets but this
doesn't mean that I'm perfect and that I
can
have a cutting edge on all the things
and be very precise
but I prefer to rely to the fact that by
analyzing the markets they're in the
whole
assets that are given
that can be an element of
high probability then provided to my
broker
levels of stop loss and take profit
I take profit the moment is enough for
me and or probably then I
have an intuition that currency from
that point on might retrace so it's
better to get out of the markets
sometimes I'm right sometimes I get
enough profit but then I could have
taken a little bit more that we know
always that after a big move there are
that can be even days of
ranging and
consolidation so I
don't like to
leave my
currencies to Moorhead and leave my
trades two more days of
swap conditions
spread that then can rise all of a
sudden and things like that so it's
always a probability game there is no
certainty uncertain on this
forecasts there's only a better vision
of the things a little bit more clear
vision of the things and
we can do this also by taking all the
charts and
getting them one by one or
analyzing
only the few charts in this case it was
osseous frank
jose yen
GBP Australian dollar and
Aussie card okay
here I have a foreign dollar New Zealand
dollar and as you can see from the
ending of the other session and the
overlapping
with the London session
there was a
decay
which was meaning the
the would distract the weakness of
Australian dollar against New Zealand
dollar so this kind of uncertainty and
breaking of some levels for example this
line yellow line we are not box as you
was for me a kind of alert to decide not
to go further
yeah there are some issues that some of
you
requested me to clarify because some of
you are saying well but I how can I do
that if I don't have your active advisor
you can always analyze the charts or
analyze the data on higher time frame
and making some computations on Excel
which was from the beginning of my
studies was in Excel
then what I did was to
try to shape the formulas as much as
possible to be
embedded on an expert advisor that could
have calculated by take the values on
every time frame and the moment that
trick was made that for me was possible
to analyze the charts
almost instantly and decide if it was
would have been a good moment for
trading or not and the fact that I'm
doing this brief
videos
it's also because no matter what that at
this moment we are the 30 the 30th of
December I am showing you anyway some
values you can take notice of them on a
monthly basis on a weekly basis and you
can stop the video for a while and take
notice of them and on a daily basis
of course now we are at the ending of
the day
there are some market configurations
that are accomplishing the
the American session and probably there
will be another job see here how the
volumes are
are displayed but that's not the only
thing that we must see we must also see
a kind of correlation between currency
pairs and what we are analyzing here for
example this work is happening in the
1-minute chart
so
sometimes I had only two currencies
because they are there are only two
currencies well defined in this in this
panel but other times
there are maybe two currencies that can
be traded and we're talking about not
very long-term
trading but
just they trade
but we can achieve enough pips
that we might then have that with only
one
two three four trades
we can have this kind of results and
this is very simple math to apply and
once you have identified that
Australian dollar is strong and it's
quite strong and at the same time there
are more currencies that are weak it
means that
Australian dollar is long and
going long in Australian dollars they're
going short with Swiss franc in this
case
with
Japanese yen
with
palm and with cap
or at least this were the values that at
this hour okay
857 849 8:15 in the morning
there were the more
evident the more relevant
so
at that point I decided that I should
have distributed the risk of my trade
instead of putting stop losses that
could have been probably kept
avoiding
the possible profit and
let the market breathe a bit
also because there are there is the
component of the spread that we always
have to deal with
and
the longer you see the more we are
analyzing the longer time frame the
higher time frames the more these
results which are correlation between
currencies
are stable at least for enough time to
make some tips I
am thinking if there are some other
questions but I received a lot of emails
and
also I got a lot of Skype conversations
with some of you and
[Music]
actually I think that
to have a better understanding of what
I'm saying you can also refer to
the other videos the previous videos I
made and
see what values are displayed and
understand that trick
in the Forex the difficult part is that
this values are very hard to detect by
only taking a couple of currency pairs
just because you think that the majority
of liquidity is in euro and yen and
gbp/usd
so you are always focusing on those
charts but
you have to understand that Forex is
like just one big number and all these
are fractions of this number
the fact that we are having a page and a
port where euro is at the top and
nominator and denominator is USD it's
ready
a
suggestion that we are talking about a
fraction of something and
the hole is
the zero sum that comes from all these
values put together
so analyzing only specific charts
doesn't mean that we are analyzing the
whole market and
the calculations that we can do now of
course I'm also using the lower
timeframes especially
for the
graphical module that I am developing
when I have time of course because it's
very
tiring sometimes to code for hours
but
and in this case of course I I am
applying the same algorithm to a lower
timeframe and I can afford also to have
a vision of a very short time frame
analysis but from a larger view
we may notice let's see let's look at
five minutes we may notice the
channeling that it's occurring at this
moment and we also can see how the price
actions is distributing along the main
market sessions in the world every day
and
we can do some assumptions also on
the fact that we can compare
the
reckon session of today with the
American session of yesterday and
yesterday before and the same for the
European session and the other session
so
the evaluation of what to trade is not
given only and exclusively
by
this values and stop it in fact as as
you saw in my
my
balancier and report I
was so
eager to
also trade New Zealand dollar that even
if the move has been
was done I decided to put some pending
orders hoping in a very fast retracement
and then proceeding in that direction
but that didn't occur so I made
sometimes also evaluations that are not
responding or maybe we don't know what
kind of money
institutions are moving we can alway
always know after
but
when we assume that we are analyzing the
overall strength and weakness and we see
that in the monthly New Zealand dollar
is strong and also strallan dollar is
quite strong and GBP is very weak for
example and in the weekly there is also
this coherence
and in the daily there is also this
coherence even if the values are a bit
different
but even we know you know that every
currency has its own range of
oscillation and
then we can make some assumptions for
the long term that can be hours and
wait for the moon if the moon
didn't occurred yet okay
so
even in this example
the person Taj was quite
positive and
satisfied with satisfaction I can say
that
realizing this profit and
in
36 40 hours
it can be even enough for the whole week
by only trading at the end for assets
and
let the market go without any
problem on the stop-loss because
if for example I would have noticed that
the value of Australian dollar was
decaying like he's doing now this is why
I am closing the trades but on a daily
basis and
that my balance would have been negative
I would have closed the trades and take
the little loss instead of
hoping on something that would have
happened but the moment I saw that the
Australian dollar was getting even
stronger than the New Zealand dollar for
at least the day of
yesterday evening I decided to let the
trade evolve to this evening and then
close with this decent profit okay so I
thank you for
watching this video and also the videos
before for subscribe in my channel and
for your emails and feedbacks and
I of course invite you if you're curious
because a lot of you are asking me about
how to achieve this kind of approach
to watch my previous videos on which
also I show in some webinars I'll turn
on eyes
with the charts bar and
some currency pairs and make us some ins
assumptions even if it
restricted way but
personally I developed this for my own
strategy and
what I can do for those who are
interested of course to have it you have
always to contact me privately but
for those who are willing anyway to have
an insight in the markets what can I do
by making this video because of course
today
tomorrow can be different ok but
for us to guard the weekly and monthly
these values are still some meaning and
if you can get some information from
these values I follow the tutorials that
I've made they can be also good for you
and for your evaluation and of course
I'm not suggesting to trade anything and
in the sense that
trading is very a personal thing I
can tell you to this to that because I
am doing this on my time training on my
daily
cycle that can be different from you it
can be on other part of the world you
can work while I am in front of the
trading platform or vice versa and I can
give you an information
that for me is in time and when you get
it it's out of time so
what I'm showing here is an example on
how to do the things but of course if
you have seen my previous videos and got
some
understanding and of this values in
themselves then of course this monthly
weekly and daily values that I am we
showing you again can be useful for
adding a point of
evaluation along with your methodology
of trading because there are many
methodologies for achieving results in
trading and I'm not saying that this is
the only one but this is mine so this is
my own way to approach the markets and
what we see here for sure is not
forecast but it's what is happening in
real time
an evaluation of real-time evaluation
of
what is going on in the markets okay so
as usual
take care thanks for everything for
supporting and
have a good time and good space
