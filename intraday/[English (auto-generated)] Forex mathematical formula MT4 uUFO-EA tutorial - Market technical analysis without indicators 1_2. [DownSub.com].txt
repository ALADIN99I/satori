hi everybody and welcome to this new
video tutorial for us regard my way to
analyze the forex market
without the use of an indicator but
rather using my own expert advisor which
analyzes smooth honestly multiple
currency pairs
receiving as final report
the flow of
currencies for the day
as usual I injected some trades today
and
at this moment we are having this
situation
in a while I will go
through this elements as usual just to
give a brief report and also to
share some values in a way that can be
usable for your analysis you you decide
yourself how to trade but I think that I
already explained
quite extensively in my previous videos
in regards to how to analyze and read
the charts at least what is my
approach to forex once I decided not to
follow any more any kind of indicator or
automated expert advisor the analysis
comes
to the reading of
multiple charts alternately real at
least 28 currency pairs on different
time frames and
these are the results so as usual I'll
show you also
this
actual report of this account for
example purposes as usual on which I
made some trades already taking some
profit which were the very first one as
I started very early to place my orders
but then having a confirmation of the
trend I decided to load a bit the charge
of the
of the trades as I was
pretty sure with with a very high
probability that my analysis was correct
for this day
these are traits actually running in
this moment that's - also a brief
table report so now we have the actual
situation at this moment
so
okay so as you can see we have
two thousand seven hundred and eighty
and something which is
and these are the transactions that I
decided to take profit and these are the
transaction already still running and at
this moment I have take this profit
from nineteen trades okay
in regards the analysis I decided to
trade today
this is the first week of January
2018 and
his first day and
we come from
raging situation of certain currency
pairs and tragic situation of some
others
briefly I
take took some trades in this area that
I kept and I'm about of course to close
at the end to show the final report as
usual
on GBP Australian dollar which we see
here and a five minutes charts was a
ranging situation between the three main
sessions of the markets and
these are actually the two
trades
realizing about 100 pips
sorry yes 62 peeps here 54 sofa like
that hundred
110 pips then the GBP New Zealand dollar
which was instead New Zealand dollar was
quite
strong today and
therefore
taking the trade more or less in the
same area of time on the other lapping
of the
American session with the local session
and
then therefore New Zealand dollar was
strong against the dollar so
we may see that in this area I took also
New Zealand dollar US dollar in by in
this case and
also was a bit captured by yen which I
decided to
take a trade
let's put on five minute charts though
in this area and of course there are
some elements of my algorithm that are
coming out on specific time and not all
the times occur but it depends on the
market so in this area and taking this
profit and also New Zealand dollar which
was strong against the US dollar was
also strong against the weakest currency
at least for today which was yen and of
course there are always
possible retracements that we can
cysts so the important thing is that we
the moment we understand what are the
most weak and strong currencies as you
can see rosy and New Zealand dollar
worth quite strong it was a kind of
split in situation this is the monthly
view okay
Australian dollar and New Zealand dollar
appeared to be strong for today yen very
weak US dollar very weak compared to
euro that I prefer not to touch
Swiss franc I decided not to touch and
GBP
very
neutral but in some how negatives of how
in anaphase of raging mode which combine
it with Australian dollar with New
Zealand dollar with yen and I'm sorry an
Aussie and New Zealand dollar with yen
and US dollars I could have injected
some trade that made sense together in
fact as you may see I
went longer on OC yen also goes in thigh
and yang was himself and GBP was to be
short and Aussie long again and also New
Zealand dollar long again and New
Zealand dollar long again PI and PI here
again Stevens US dollar and Japanese yen
and these are the points realize or pips
in / time it's up to you it's the same
condition of course here we are
analyzing a multi time frame also for
your
for your help and of course I always
invite you to
make a comparison with your Metatrader
platform with your broker I use my
specific broker on which I designed this
algorithm and that works the best in my
opinion
this is the also the weekly situation
and we see that even in the weekly
situation we got Australian dollar New
Zealand aura with the same values of
course is the first week and is the
first month so they collide together
they are the same for us regard the
daily
situation we have a GBP negative
Palsy
somehow positive but we are looking at
the day
situation at this moment New Zealand
dollar very strong Japanese yen again
very weak and US dollar week
okay so based on these values that you
can
pause the video for a second and then
somehow
make your assumptions on the trades
these are the results that if we go and
take
the positive kurtosis are these elements
that now I am about to trade so we cap
in at the moment New Zealand dollar was
taken in this area New Zealand dollar
against yen in body and
so this were
the dips accordingly to also this
the presentation of profit and
I'm doing this also working and
enhancing because I got new ideas and
new formulas that are represented also
by this we are older now come appears in
my in my algorithm and suggest the
possible probability of movement of this
of the specific currency pair and as
well I unanswered also the channeling
that is composing why the price action
is doing this movie
was the yen
this was
the result and now we're seeing a kind
of decay of the channeling so we better
be careful about possible other
retracement even if the situation now
it's almost the end of the market and I
always suggest a daily
day trading and every day
try to understand what are the current
system are going to move okay and we
have needs even dollar US dollar can buy
as well and
that was
the result
GBP need $7 himself got two positions
left and
GBP Australian dollar in sell of course
in a very nice point of
attachment of course there is no swap so
or trades made today and
so let's do the final
statement for today
only true statement but it's quite
enough because I also want to
give some answers and this is the very
nice curve
that has been obtained at with this
trades and this
profit
okay and that can be given of course i
over traded a bit but the moment I was
having confirmation that my trades were
in the right direction I decided to take
multiple positions in order to enhance
my the effectiveness of my trade and
this is a personal way to approach the
trade so every one has its own way more
conservative more aggressive this this
depends on you the only important thing
is that markets are read in a proper way
okay
some words about okay so this is the
final balance as you can see fourteen
thousand three hundred and eighty-two
8.24
fourteen hundred
3.24 okay and these are the trades that
I have executed okay so
I
said I was almost finished with my
graphical module that that can be
probably implemented also for other
instruments financial instruments but at
the moment it's only available and in
this case I am replying to some
questions I got the email so bear with
me for those who have made these
questions
at this moment is available only for
the forex market
some of you were asking me about if
there are any PDFs or books that I can
suggest to read or if I created any the
for boat
to explain this I don't have time for
this
because I am working on my algorithm
almost every day
and enhancing this this graphical module
with formulas that are then creating the
lines okay so what we normally do by for
example doing this even if we think we
are painting in real we are making a
graphical representation of a
mathematical formula okay so this is
very obvious that
in order to create this kind of
zigzagging and other stuff that you may
see even if you don't understand what
it's about but the more
Garrido is used the more revealeth
reveals itself
what can I suggest to read I
wonder how many of you are
passing the majority of their time
by reading the charts
the system your book you all must read
if you want to
if you want to have some
information about Forex
there is a lot of out there I'm
not saying that I am the perfect person
which gives the
magic formula there is no magic formula
at all there is only an interpretation
that can have a variation from the
person to person but indeed I
can surely tell you that the book I read
every day
trying to decipher what
the book is telling is the charts itself
the price action
the volumes that
suggest me some kind of activity and
the currencies taken as a single unit
some of you are also asking if they can
have this algorithm and given me as a
support
thing in Bitcoin
so a few words about Bitcoin
Bitcoin for me is exactly nothing it's
okay
you see this this is a euro coin and
this is something tangible physical okay
you can touch it
so what is Bitcoin
it's a digit
even you wrong card Swiss franc and so
on those are digits in the actual
electronic markets but they have a
counterpart
almost close to a commodity
in fact when I'm trading or analyzing
the markets this is the suggestion that
I can give to you as well and also that
you can find in my previous videos and
especially in the webinars I
tend to treat
Forex and the currencies as commodity as
as the commodity market so like oil
sugar it's only that the commodity is a
currency that exported in another
currency like oil is put in dollars or
sugary sport in dollars or
[Music]
even the pays and the quote that we had
in every car superlight usd/cad is us
east bay's and carries the court all
seek add new ROC is the base and carries
the court USD and Ozzy can be seen can
be perceived as commodities and
that are quoted in a
in another chorus and the game the
probability game that we have to face
every day
is to
win the challenge to
analyse if which currencies for that
they are the strongest and the weakest
so that
reasoning in
in
speculative way by having something very
strong against something very weak or
vice-versa we can have
enough profit or pips that are
translated that improv
so for me the questions about Bitcoin
you can
you can somehow
asked someone else because I'm not very
skilled on that and I refuse totally the
idea of all the crypto part currencies
that are
even more manipulated than the forex
market which is a semi regulated market
so already with some
sometimes tough money food manipulations
by institutions and central banks but
that on the other hand has shown as a
physical counterpart that
makes it somehow tangible and
with probability predictable
another thing is cryptocurrencies or
this vr-12
virtual assets that to me probably
because I belong to a different era
makes notes make no sense and give even
more confusion even because I can
somehow
make a correlation
between the currency pairs because each
currency is related to another mrs.
price in another currency so there is a
inter relation correlation and in this
case to me is fair enough
to proceed with an analysis
but this
this kind of
[Music]
approach fails the moment we are
discussing about cryptocurrencies so for
me when you want to speak about Bitcoin
as well when you want to speak about any
other cryptocurrency
another person
for that topic okay I'm sorry but
already forex market is a very huge
element
then sometimes it's more easy to read
other times is more difficult
depending on the way we approach to that
but really if you really want to
have a a
better vision of the thing what I
suggested to read is to read the chart
every day every chart that it's possible
okay in this case I just selected one
two three four and five five charts on
which I decided to differentiate my risk
trading multiple assets coherently
so
if I think that million dollar is strong
Japanese yen is weak and GBP New Zealand
dollar the sorry and GBP is weed of
course there has to be a coherency that
I buy when insulin tolerance varies and
I sell one needs in another squad of
course Japanese yen is always quote so
in this case i buy i buy but at the same
time GBP is weak and also is strong so
GBP is base I sell and
Posie is strong bye bye okay so this
kind of approach they buy they maybe
can can be not very familiar at the
beginning but we must consider the
currency is like
giving and taking something okay we have
to have another currency to trade with
the currency that we are buying or
selling
for this reason and the fact that they
are
the part of a whole
big number altogether
this is the way I do approach to this
analysis and
no other
even even commodities or index indexes
for me are a topic that at this moment
I'm not about to touch a roll or to give
any kind of suggestions of approach
anyway the graphical module is almost
finished I'm taking some extra time we
find some formulas and
experiment their coherency through time
and understand what is the best
timeframe to apply them even if some of
them are applied on a daily timeframe
and I always suggest you to have a bold
vision of at least the day if not the
week and even the month is good to know
for
sometimes swing trading of a couple of
days other times for having more
confirmation of
the trade of an intraday trading of some
hours
there are also some elements that I have
just implemented like this line this one
and this one
which are related to the previous day
activity of the price action and as you
may notice in this case the moment the
price
broke this level there was a treatment
and a kind of really support or sorry
resistant resistance area that confirmed
that I was right to sell Japan sell GBP
and buy New Zealand dollar as well as
for example this other
let me see is this one the face yes as
you may notice we have also here
this line which was the same as in the
the GBP here okay we have this brown
line and this blue line and here again
we have this brown line and this blue
line is - these are coming from a
profusely activity and I love the high
and the low as you see the higher the
lower the produce they are something
else
but it's always made by calculation and
even in this case the price
found support of this area and by the
fact that was rejected above this this
line
suggested mean a coherence with these
values in regards of trading because
sometimes we have very huge values
let's bring the monthly like for example
hard on this case let's say the maximum
the minimum value is Japanese yen okay
but how can I tell if this is the
minimum value reached or if this value
is about to continue to decrease
this we don't know because every every
day and every week there are different
values values are not the same this is
why Forex is quite complex to trade but
the fact that
some levels are
broken like in this case see here same
example in this case on the New Zealand
dollar Japanese yen we have this blue
line
and we just
I
have this blue line and this brown line
orange line
calculated from the day before and the
price went up there it rejected but
stating this area that rejected but
arrived this threshold and then bump it
up again breaking this area so I got a
confirmation that
needs even tolerate Japanese yen were
confirmed in their daily it's even
dollar and Japanese yen values of plus
five hundred and minus 400 in this case
so and even in the weekly
plus three hundred and - almost four
hundred so
by reading the chart
the first act to produce at least to
read and give an interpretation to the
Pharisees that solves the debate
components of the major 28 currency
pairs or crosses that we can trade so
this is the first step
then from the step we
we take out the strongest and the
weakest currency or currencies it
depends that can be just one for strong
and one for week or two for strong and
two for weak it depends on the assets of
the day
once we had
analyzed and taken the currency pairs
that are the result of the crossing of
these currencies sometimes we have the
base in the quote we apply the same
algorithm which provide us in the time
frame that we are observing the values
of the currencies themselves that are no
matter the chart and simple that we're
using they're always related to a market
view and then we go and this is why it's
important also to have a graphical
vision of the of the markets and see
also how the price behaved in proximity
of the overlapping of the
major
market sessions and how and see the
development this is fundamental
information inside technical analysis
believe me for me I'm not
fundamental
analyst but for me it's very fundamental
to when when
when markets overlap and give some kind
of signal that that can be confirmed
okay so
what has to say
by doing this kind of activity the
result of today was
this
graphic
totally in profit and
you may as usual make your
considerations about
all these elements that are giving you
better insight of how
the trades developed
so for today it's all I thank you for
watching and always for subscribing and
supporting my channel and your questions
and your contacts and
while
hoping to produce another video based
also on some of the questions that you
are
providing me almost daily I wish you a
very good time and space and a very good
trade activity okay
bye
