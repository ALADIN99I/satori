hello fellow traders and welcome to this
new video of unconventional Forex
trading today I'm gonna be very brief
due to the large amount of emails that I
got in these past weeks of January and
December as well after my latest videos
and webinars that of course I strongly
suggest you if you are interested on
this topic to to take your time to watch
and have a view of what I did in order
to then follow this one or make
kind of compendium of information today
I will briefly
give recap and attempt to give some
answers to the many different mails that
I got, mean time is of course as you can
notice running the sound of MT4 in the
background ... as I was saying I will try to
answer to the most frequently asked
questions in regards to my system hoping
that in the future at least by watching
this video and watching the previous
videos that I made everything could be
more clear and if you really want to
contact me privately via email or Skype
at least for these questions you have a
read your answer so you will contact me
for further information and more
specific ones okay?.. so prior to start
with this as usual I always bring an
example of trade ... an example of the
strategy that I use combining also with
the Excel spreadsheets as usual in order
to show the whole process of gathering
data from mt4 than analyzing data and
then projecting some forecasts and
placing the trades
getting some profit hopefully okay... so
let's start first with
the actual situation ...today's it's
Thursday the 23rd of January 2020 as you
may notice here  from this date
and the situation of the market since
the beginning of the day that started
around this bar so sixty-three bars ago
in terms of 15 minutes time frame bars
showed immediately that the currency
that was strong so to be traded as
strong currency was the Australian
dollar despite the fact that today the
situation is quite messy and oscillating
and despite the fact that around
two o'clock AM... there was this huge spike in
movement
I had anyway to decide to make a
trade and also copied my trade mirror at
my trade on a team account in order to
give an explanation and an example of
trading opportunity so after analyzing
this information also accordingly to the
formula that I already presented in the
previous video of a kind of oscillator
and the analysis of 28 pairs
normalized and brought them together in
the graph I waited for the starting of
the London session in order to project
my trades as you may notice we had this
situation let me just this is the GBPAUD
on a 15 minute time frame and that you
can see around 1:00 2:00 o'clock AM there
was this big spike sentencing that
Aussie was behaving strong and then
there was this ranging situation...
I injected my trades around this price area okay and then
i wanted to make some profit and then I
closed my trades... the initial balance of
course was as usual of ten thousand
units of currency and I place it some
trades multiple trades but basically
just all the currencies against all the
currency pairs against the Aussie
therefore basically I made seven
positions my portfolio was made
of seven currency pairs all the pair's
against the Aussie let's also give a
brief summary of this there was only
negative one negative trade that was
injected by the state as I clicked the
wrong pair and then I closed that I
closed immediately because was related
to GBPNZD
and as you can see that
was a minimal amount that I just made by
mistake but what is important to notice
despite this this practical error was
the fact that the result my trades was
about 14% in 3-4 hours of trading and
with a total trades of 22 so 21 trades
in real 3 units per each pair related
to AUD ...let me check this okay so
basically you notice that AUD behaved
very strong with the spikes at the
beginning of the day but then around the
beginning of the London session there
was this big spike up and after a bit of
retracement by following my my analysis
and the fact that the AUD was
starting to fall as well as some
currencies that were getting some
strength so that was starting to weaken
that for me was the moment to close the
trades and take the profit so after all
this is a great equity curve with a
profit factor I hope you can see
read all the trades all the numbers you
can check and verify with your mentor
trade a platform with your broker if
everything matches so that's always this
crucial thing from myself that I would
like really for you to verify what I'm
saying what I'm doing
so basically almost a hundred percent of
positive results in three four hours
okay so this was the result and
basically the questions that I got since
my previous video always talking about
this topic that I got in a large amount
in these past weeks I tried to make a
sum of them put them together summarized
them and at this moment now I will
briefly give an answer for each and
every one so that would be more clear
for those who are writing me about my
methodology so let's go further so this
is the final balance
okay so for as regards my methodology, my
system the minimum requirements for
installing and working with this it's
about to have Windows 10 computer with
Windows 10 always up to date is very
important and I explain also why in my
previous video so please please please
watch this video watch my previous
videos first then re-watch this for the
questions and then if you feel the need
of course then write me or contact me
via Skype as you usually do as I was
saying with the stand computer up to
date with an Intel Core i5 or i7 which
is better and a licensed Microsoft Excel
copy in order to work of course with
Excel spreadsheets of course Metatrader
is necessary for this for running the
expert advisor that grabs the
information from Metatrader and delivers
the markets data to excel
spreadsheet of course it's more likely
to have an ECM broker together to have
reliable data and information and of
course you need to have quite enough
fast internet connection
for as regards those who are willing to have
the system and that are writing me about
there are some considerations to do that
I will do that right now
for as regards the installation basically
the system requires to have installed in
your computer the expert advisor some
VBA's files batch files for  the
dialogue between Metatrader and Excel
that I have built by myself that I'm
using as personal tools for my trading
of course there's also some Excel
configuration for the spreadsheet in
itself and there's also a final system
testing and this can be done by me via
remote access usually by using
TeamViewer and this job will require for
each PC on which you want to have this
installed will require about one hour
for has regard then of course the
related mentoring that would be done
one-to-one I normally use exclusively
Skype for Skype in English and also by
using the screen sharing to so that I
can follow your screen and guide you to
the process so all the system works this
price is impersonal formulas
implementation because as I showed my
system comes with the basic but
essential setup that is the setup that
is required in order
to make some analysis on market analysis
but at the same times the spreadsheets
allows to implement with your
own formulas this time formulas that are
applied not to the pairs but the currencies
pairs... not the currency pairs but to the currencies
so we apply the formula to
the currencies created as clusters of
currency pairs and of course for all the
details that would be the topic of the
mentoring session okay I will not take
too much time to explain everything now even
because a lot of this has already been
explained in my previous webinars okay
that you can always rewatch on this
channel of course there's also part of
the mentoring session it's related to
the money management and some
fundamental analysis that has to
necessarily be integrated with the math
Math approach that I have (which represents
the 75% of the analysis)... we have always
taking consideration that we are moving
in markets that are moved by
institutions and by "big hands" decisions
so we have always to be careful and not
give anything for granted and try to
analyze and be cautious and be able to
create some profit without leaving our
money in the market for such a long time
so it's all about a Day trading
activity
then of course the moment someone has
the system it's suggested to
have some self-training on a demo
account for about one week or two this
is a math based analysis and this math
based analysis it's done to support
manual trading environment so we're not
talking about automated trading it's a
manual trading and of course everyone
has its own skills everyone has his own
level of understanding of ability and
because of this it takes a bit of time
not a much but it's completely different
mentality and approach that has to be
built within you within yourself in
order to be confident by using
currencies and then converting
currencies to currency pairs because of
this it takes a bit of training you know
an every day training testing
understanding analyzing understanding
attempting a trade so for this couple of weeks
... from one to two weeks of training
it's the average time required in order
to become to start to have some positive
performances for us regard the mt4 back
testing I got a lot of requests on this
"... can I back test your system?"...
in this case the back testing the
standard back testing of my system which
is of course the T-WIN...
trade W.I.N. strategy is not like a normal
expert advisor that can be run on the
back testing feature of MT4
MT4  does back test on single
currency pairs... this system analyzes
simultaneously 28 currency pairs and if
you want to do some kind of back testing
you have to do it in the training
situation because it has to be done in
real time market conditions is not
possible to even because the expert
advisor itself it's necessary just to
gather the data and then other kinds of
testing are not possible the moment you
are analyzing and injecting the trades
after an analysis that comes from Excel
not Metatrader okay some questions were
regarding the fact that I'm using the 15
minutes timeframe ... let's be clear the
analysis it's using 15 minutes at this
moment what I'm showing here it's based
on bars of 15 minutes okay
but the analysis itself it's made on a
daily basis and of course the expert advisor that run
and gets the data can run also on
a different timeframe 1 minute 5 minutes
15 of course 30 or 60 minutes without
any problem so the timeframes below
the daily time frame but normally I found that
for this kind of approach and analysis
and representation on Excel the 15
minutes time frames is the best
compromise in order to have some
detailed information and at the same
time with not much bars the the overall
view of the day okay so this is my
personal choice due to different
experiments and different situations
that I have tested and the optimal
configuration but anyway it's also
possible to to analyze in very detail
for example in with one minute timeframe
bars for as regard the fact that some of
you may want to have some consulting
from my person well of course there is
an email also in the video description
and also on my channel but anyway this
is my email so mtalgosolutions @ gmail.com
but please first send me an
email with your presentation and i want
to be clear one-line emails or even
nonsense emails very straightforward
emails without any presentations or
whatever or emails also with attached
files that I don't know where they come
from whatever they would be discarded
immediately so please be specific and
present yourself as well as I am
presenting every time I I do a video
okay and also when I speak with skype
and after this email  you can
reach me through Skype so at my contact
to Skype and then message me
on Skype and
course we will find the time maybe to
have a chat a voice chat on skype
...costs... of course this system itself is a system
that I worked on on it for about four or
five years almost five years now I can
say without any doubt and so it has its
own value but for this reason and also
for the fact that then the requests are
very specifically individual and also
related to the level of skill that each
one has and which is different we can
discuss of this for sure on on skype
when we talk ok and finally and this is
a point that is not a question that I
got but something that I want to be
clear the system is not unlimited I will
not give to everyone and forever the
system even because it's good to keep
something rare and not that much
spreaded in order also to to give rarity
and save some privacy for us regard the
trading so this system would be limited
and after I will reach a certain number
of requests that will be fulfilled I
will stop to provide the system in the
sense that it will be no longer
available to further requests and this
will be discretional so I will decide a
moment I would reach certain number of
people I'm sorry but this will be
limited for my choice because remember
that this is my personal - these are my
personal
tools and knowledge and as I am private
operator and doing this also making a
compromise for as regards my time and my
rules so if this is my policy okay so
you can always follow my channel you can
always see the webinars that I do and
the information that I release and that
I have released in the past because now
I have almost 70 videos that you can
watch so and majority are webinars with
information and experiences that I share
so this is very crucial that you
understand also this point okay so this
is this is it
this is all I hope that this it's quite
clear in terms of the most common
questions that every time you watch a
couple of my videos then immediately you
go to your mail and then you ask always
the same question and because I would
like to enjoy my time and save my time
with this video I hope you get
always the answer and I hope that this
video would be watch over and over from
the majority of you so that I will have
more quality in my emails and that I can
give more support to those who are
willing to go further or have experience
of my techniques and my advices and
would like to discuss about this or
share together their experience with all
the said I thank you for watching this
brief video ... thank you for
subscribing my channel thank you
for the support and anyway I have to
mention also the many beautiful words
that I receive every time and that they
give motivation to my work give me some
you know extra stamina for for going
further and as usual have a good time
with space and enjoy life...
BYE!
