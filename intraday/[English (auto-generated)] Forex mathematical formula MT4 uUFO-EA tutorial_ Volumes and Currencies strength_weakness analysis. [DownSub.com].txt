hi everybody welcome to this new video
tutorial
using my usual expert advisor for the
market analysis the forex market
analysis today I will talk a bit
reply to some questions that I received
about volumes but as usual about
currency and weakness the currency
strength and currency weakness
analysis and showing you reports of
another live example the usual
the start first from the platform
actually on trading
today is the 10th of January 2018 so
please
take check to your meta trader platform
to compare the values whatever as usual
I invite you to with that and of course
I also show you what is occurring on a
monthly basis in the market
performance so we can see here actually
we have the situation with euro USD
weaker Japanese yen New Zealand dollar
are quite strong
we are talking about the monthly
view oszi
medium strong GBP Swiss franc we can
carve the medium strong but then we go
into the weekly which is the more
interesting for the trader at least I
used today by comparing weekly and daily
the charts
we see that
Japanese yen is the key for today
which was very strong against Europe
against oszi GBP and CAD which are the
trades that are injected also Trading
New Zealand dollar because at this hour
when I launched at my trades there was
also some weakness of New Zealand dollar
that anyway appear to be much more
strong than awesome okay and also in the
daily as usual you can notice the values
here that are showing cat week GBP week
again somehow the most strong the
strongest with Japanese yen and
therefore I went short against with all
the currencies against the yen from
detail statement report that you may
notice at the beginning I luncheon to
two units per symbol so so unit so cozy
CAD euro gbpn at $7 and along the way I
took some trades some profit from the
trade which is which is this profit
consolidated profit and also I had
floating profit that
based on the last
statement I did was at this level now we
are about 200 euros more and these are
the points of profit made of course as
you can see it's even dollar ten please
verify all the information the data that
you see you can come back in the video
and pause it and and make your
evaluations
brief analysis on the currency so let's
take 15 minute chart and you see I I
went short
with the CAD against the yen in this
area and then the price
felt of course there was this
orange line as usual that I described it
might produce two videos a kind of trash
hold on which if it's violated then it
it enhances the probability that
the price will proceed in that direction
as well as GBP let's take it 15 minutes
and
we may see that the same behavior
occurred here even if the GBP Yun
started to full already at the beginning
of the other session and then proceeded
a further
also yen
let's grab the 15 minutes charts
which I don't understand why is
represented this way let's see in the 30
minutes
and here the same thing okay bang around
this level
so the two blue line and orange line
which are calculated from the previous
day and
disposed
the behavior of the cross that we got
you wrong
same behavior see
the orange and the blue line and then
look how the price went down and we
trace it of course but now it's going
down again and I don't know for how long
because I have to read the market now
they are somehow reacting in a ranging
phase and finally the New Zealand dollar
which was the most harder battle because
New Zealand dollar has some inner
strength and in fact we can see the
volatility and how the price we trace it
to above this level of this threshold
after breaking it and then proceeding
down again but we are almost at the end
of the European session at this moment
and then
we have just the last hours of the
American session a few words on
let's first do a simple thing
let's put all the timeframes in a minute
so I can show you and therefore answer
to the question that I got
as usual via email some of you are and
there were at least four emails that
were asking me about volume so I decided
to make a brief
a brief tutorial regard that because in
real even if I trade without indicators
the only indication that I use is
volumes that for me it's
important information in terms of
activity that occurs a specific price
level and that can help me to read the
price action along with the channels
that are built in my
graphical module that can
but give me a better idea of what is
going on in regards to the level of
price and then how the price behaves
after reading that values
let's do if I can also
a
detailed report
today the platform seems to behave a bit
weird I don't know if you had the same I
try to make
upgrades of
Windows but it says there is a kind of
bug that doesn't allow me to make
as usual
but I will do it at the end of course no
problem now we are having this account
with this
this value that is reflected here and
at the moment I was making this
temporary
trading floating from open trades and
having this equity which is somehow
reflected in the equity that I have it
now
let's stop for a brief in regards to the
this module this enhancement you may see
that there are some candlesticks which
have this yellow dot and
basically we can
just
get rid of the volumes
I don't
okay I
just started the platform some minutes
ago I was closing the computer as I told
you for the upgrades of the updates of
Windows 10 that sometimes it's very
messy and can cause also issues with all
the software that are related with
getting some
information from the network and today
is one of the messy days
anyway we see that there are these
yellow dots there appears on inserting
candlesticks which reveal
an increase meant of the volume activity
at a specific price level and that can
suggest
the behavior of
the price
in regards to the fact that for example
here I've just been
settled up another point yellow point
and let's see how the price behaves
towards this yellow point which it's
like if it was a part here of volumes
but in real its volume activity related
to
price level okay and also related to
channeling
the rates
designed by a formulation that reads
that it's taken from from my expert
advisor for my algorithm so this is this
potential combination of
potential combination of
determining
levels of support resistance and fair
price on the long term
sorry medium term and very short term
and answered with the fact that I know
for example that on this one-minute
candlestick the volumes were here and
the price went up and then there was
some
volumes activity right here and then the
price started to
fall and now there is shaping can you
see another
another yellow dot here which
is
considering the volumes even if we are
not seeing them here that are
detected by the analysis of the
algorithm
rising
at this price level so instead of having
a vertical analysis of the volume of
which our bar by bar
our
position on the chart on the very same
chart we are observing which is easier
to make our considerations
therefore we see that there was a very
high volume here that pushed the price
up
but then at this level of support
resistance of the short term there was
another
volume activity
that
pulled the price down and again around
this level there was another
volume activity that pushed the price
down even more
but now we have to see if the price is
oscillating along this
they lock this line this line that is
cleared
or if is going to break this line and
fall down
and really worried about creating now an
account history because I saw that there
are some issues let's try again let's
see if they're more
lucky yeah we are
so let's put
yeah
so see this is what is actually going on
and
so when I do
observe
and another analyze the markets first of
all I always refer to the
market performance of the currencies I
choose what currencies are strong and
what are the ones that are weak and then
I open the related charts in this case
were all against the yen yen long and
GDP pussycat euro and at seven dollar
short and then
normally I was observing the the volumes
in this area but I found more profitable
to enhanced
this graphical module with a subroutine
that I created so months ago
that
puts on on chart
tick by tick and
candlestick by candlestick
when and where
the volumes are
appearing and occurring so that it's
easier to make considerations about the
price ranging and floating and more and
your solution of the price
that could be significant also for some
sculpting activity as well as for
positioning our trades the moment we
have identified
the currencies that we are
you have decided to trade okay so for
example in this bar that just occurred
the price open here went down a bit and
when the price was going up there was
some buying pressure
price arrived to this level and
then
open here the next bar and there was
some
volumes activity at this level and then
the price went down retrace it and then
let's see what it's going to do to the
next into the next bar of course as you
can see we have level of support and
resistance here that are painting
because of the formulas that are
calculated
yeah and
as you may notice there are some
coherences between the volumes and the
risin of the price of courses if the
volumes of course in the lower part of
the candlestick can mean that there is
some buying activity and if the volumes
of curse in the upper part of the
chemistry like here for example it means
that it could be some selling activity
recapping a bit we had 30 minute times
friends
we I got trades
in this area for us regard New Zealand
dollar yen and the
price went down after breaking this blue
this this orange line of
channeling calculated with in relation
to the activity of the price action of
the previous day
same situation for
the euro yen
same situation for
the Aussie yen
same situation and much more enhanced
because of the values of GBP onion that
now are somehow rigueur things as you
can see G please get a strong and
Japanese yen is weakening a bit and also
here is weakening so I better close and
let's see let's give it some time a bit
more and also card card as this
this very
fallen situation okay so I will now
finally and let's hope to get
we can do that so let's let's attempt to
close our trades for today I
made a final
detail report
it's not making
report
today's behaving very very weird and I
think there is an issue with
let me also just close
just close
I don't know what it's going on it's
like there is a
there is an issue with
with Windows that
doesn't allow me to create
let me do a little trick and get rid of
some memory of
I beg your pardon for this but it's for
me it's sometimes I have to deal with
this situation
when
okay finally so I
will not go again into this because you
already so all the
situation of the markets
and then you can always go back with
with the video and we play that so at
the end I closed I made only this trades
today all injected between
715 yes sorry 8:00 and 8:30 so this
morning and
the final balance
was
this coming from this situation before
so enhanced I could have taken could
have closed a little bit very better as
I told you
there are some times that I have to deal
with the operating system and this is
not only for my case but in general I
can give you also the suggestion when
you have issues with your Metatrader
that it looks like is not working or
there are some issues always
check
if you made all the updates of Windows
there was an updated actually to do so I
had to close the platform made the
updates reboot the computer and then
finally we ran everything so I wanted to
do this before the ending of the
European session but anyway even in this
case
this is a
quite nice statement that with only ten
trays in Rio there are five trades
because we traded again all secant you
would appear New Zealand dollar against
the yen
sterling the basin by the court and
some there were some interesting there
is the was an interesting amount of pips
by selecting these currency pairs along
among twenty twenty eight possible
crosses that normally any broker can
provide us for trading the more the fact
that by having the
the volumes now enhanced in
the
charts instead of reading them bar by
bar but reading them along with the
price level can even enhance even better
the reading of the price action once we
have selected the currency pairs
volumes that is the way that I read the
volumes and by by having implemented the
algorithm now I will do some extra
testing because of the super team I just
took that this subroutine that I created
some months ago and now I have the game
in the graphical interface and I have
only to optimize that but by having that
that was even more enhancing because
instead of making everything by
visual calculation from below from the
line below of the graphical
representation of the values to the
price action I have it directly on my
chart I hope that this video
gave you some extra inspiration even on
how to read the volumes
related to the price action and to the
levels of support resistance and for any
other questions feel free as usual to
bribe me or contacting me via Skype
hope to have time to do that because I
have quite busy and not always I have
time for that but as soon as possible
especially I would give priority anyway
to those who are very clear in their
questions and not making some
basic questions that are very hard to
make interpretation so please be precise
in your question and if it's possible if
I have knowledge on that I will reply to
you as soon as possible thanks for
watching for subscribing and supporting
this channel and
have a good trades and have a good day
time and space
