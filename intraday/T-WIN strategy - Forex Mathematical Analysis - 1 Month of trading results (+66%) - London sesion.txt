hello back
fellow traders it's been a while
that i was not publishing any video
some months
i do apologize for this but in real also
i made many videos in the past
where i was explaining
my approach to foreign based on
mathematical
um
formulas and a mathematical approach
so i do apologize for the long time not
being
here on youtube but also for
family reasons and also this
lockdown situation
i had very limited time and energies
and despite the fact that
even without making new videos i
i got a lot of feedbacks from you
so i start this
this video by
thanking every one of you
which are still following me and writing
me
feedbacks emails or contacting me via
skype
because that that's really something
that drives
my work anyway and pushes me
somehow to do some some videos
um it's only a matter of having
timed for doing that and
what i would will talk today and i hope
to be very brief
even because still i have not that much
time
so i reserve some time for my trading
and
for my work for making some
studying new expert advisors or
attempting to find new formulas
despite now my my
job in trading is pretty stable
what i will do in this in this
video session i will just
organize it in the sense of providing
some answers
to the many questions that i daily
received
hoping to save some extra time this way
so let's start by
[Music]
saying that my
my time was pretty limited in this month
so i i attempted myself
you know to focus on on a specific
session so the london section which of
course is the
more volatile and
as i got more than one mail
saying that by watching
the other videos that i produced in the
past
majority of time i was providing you
know just one session
of trading so one day
uh that i could have been like
faking or creating some
fake results so
in order to be clear on this uh
first of all if you watch very careful
you see that majority of times
i was making a day by day
video so taking the
taking the previous results that the the
results of the previous day
and making some extra trades in the next
day
continuing uh the produce balance
and you of course you have to try to
imagine that
if you want to fix something it's just
very simple you trade
you know you open two accounts and
in one you sell something and the other
side you
buy the same asset
so one of them it's it's of course
successful but when you have to do it
in more days or weeks
that would be more hard to realize
because
for every day you have to create
since the beginning of of
the starting day that you want to make
this
last long as many
trading accounts as possible you know in
order
to make all the combination of buy and
sell because the second day
if you do the same thing anyway you need
to have
four accounts because you have to apply
other two possibilities so
what i thought it was about i don't know
if you're following this but if you make
the math
it's very simple uh it's a very simple
concept
it's an exponential
progression so what i thought was about
also to give an answer on
how the mathematical approach can
perform through
significant amount of time
and as i am testing a new broker
and of course for educational purposes
only i always use a demo account
where i replicate my trades and my
analysis
i would like to show you the results of
an entire month of trading
um so today
is the fifth of november
just to uh
center the period we are living in
uh and i'm not talking about pandemics
or
things like that but we are still in the
phase where we have to see
if donald trump or biden would be the
next president of
united states and
so we are in a very um
delicate situation for sd card the us
dollar and of course
related to dollar all the other
currencies
and of course we are also in a in a
moment where
we have sold the performances of oil
and some commodities and the market
up and downs because of all this
okay so we are what i am about to show
you
is something that has been realized
during these times
at the moment uh
i have my platform running uh actually
is the end of the london session
and so we are during the the american
session and i am not trading
as i told you i am
since uh since uh some months
focusing only on the european section
and because of this what we do see is
something that i have realized
uh based only on the british pound
okay so let's go for it
and here is
the thing so i started this
account the fourth of october
2020 okay
and this is the very last statement that
i
have created the 3 of november
the 3rd of november so exactly one month
then of course because of this broker
the
the demo platform the demo account
works for a month it has expired and
then i
created a new account
on which i traded yesterday and today to
give a kind of prosecution okay but
let's focus on the results
of this uh london session trading
um that that i made
from the 4th of october to
till the 3rd of november okay so
uh if you see all the trading
activity that then you can of course
check pause the video
verify yourself it's up to you i don't
care
um i made different
different trades of course and this
covers an
entire month okay so
i'm scrolling down a little bit i hope
it's enough
you know just to just for you to
pause the video and have a check and
as you may notice all the the trades
are using the asset an asset related to
gbp
okay okay uh of course the the trading
account let me just see if it's possible
to see
was provided with 50 000
units of currency so
the lot sizing was proportional
accordingly to some money management
rules
if this would have been less i would
have used a different lot size
okay so this just to be clear okay
so by trading the gbp which is the more
volatile
the most volatile currency in
in the london session especially
i was granting myself some
peeps every day despite the fact that
not all the days
i was realizing like a hundred percent
of being right because
uh this is a kind of uh hedging by
putting together more currencies related
to just one currency
i call it seven to one so basically the
aussie the ncd the japanese yang
the swiss franc euro
dollar and canadian against
the pound but the overall
result of combining together would have
gave me the trading of the gbp itself
okay so even if i had some negative
results
this has to be compen this has to be
sum together in order to have a
compensation which can result positive
or negative
in the overall total okay
so let's scroll let's scroll so you can
see all the trades that i made
27 of october 28th of october 29th of
october
13th of october and then
2nd of november and 3rd of november
okay so we're arriving at the end
and as you may notice
we arrived at the 3rd
of november 2020 so
exactly one month
applying the mathematical
concepts and strategies and
charting that i have
exhaustively explained in all my
previous videos
that you get that i invite you to to
watch
in order to make yourself an idea
of what i'm talking about okay this
video will be
pretty brief but just to give you an
overall
performance in a month okay so
by starting with the
initial balance of 50 000
the result was to gain
about 33 000 more
which in terms of percentage is
roughly the 66 percent
plus
respecting some money management rules
and this is the equity curve
that i got so this is
this cannot be faked okay because this
is something that
of course you see i had some negative
trades
that or that
impacted for a while my
performance but majority of time by
trading this way
when something goes wrong it doesn't go
wrong that much
majority of time goes flat okay
when instead you are
in the right direction in the right day
um the the the profit
it's much more than the loss
and this is why we have this straight
line
up of course this
is um
something that ended two days ago
so just to show you also the prosecution
i created another account with other
conditions so this one
is without commissions when the next
uh the next one has commissions
so just to test both of them because i'm
pretty intrigued by
this broker so i wanted to give it a
chance
and so for example you see the trades of
yesterday
which is which was the fourth of
november and the trades that i made
today
[Music]
so even in this case
we have pretty nice performance
which could be ideally the prosecution
so to add
another six percent seven percent
you know to the previous
uh balance those who are asking me uh
if there are because basically what i'm
using is something that i have created
and of course i still invite you to
watch my previous videos to have an idea
what i created is something that can be
referred
as a strength
and weakness analyzer
of the eight currencies and
one of the questions that i got is that
there there are many
strength analyzers on the web
like expert advisors or
things like that so i was asked
if
they could have been used
in the same way i'm using this and
my answer is yes
but with one little
specification i
don't know how they calculate
the strength and the weakness
but i know how do i do that
so that's why first of all
uh i rely on my formulas and my
calculations rather than using
the common strength and weakness
indicators that can be found
in the web in the
trading view or whatever or as expert
advisors
or else this is the first thing
so i'm using some kind of analysis of
strength and weakness and
not only because in this case i made
something focus on
the specific behavior of the gbp
but i also know
in in detail how
this strength and weakness are generated
so this is for me at least for me
an advantage because at least i know
how those formulas are calculated
first thing second thing
is that by using a strength and weakness
indicator
that you have as an expert advisor or in
the web
you cannot do extra formulas
and so you have to accept what you see
and that's it at least you can only you
know do something like this so
select a specific
asset to compare so filter a bit
but that's the only thing you can do
what i can do instead and this is
another reason why i'm using
my own property
strength and weakness indicator is
that i can make calculations so
for example let me just write the
pathway
okay so for example this
chart is the same as this chart
but based on the gbp
and for doing this starting from the
values of strength and weakness that are
displayed on these cells the simple
thing that i did
was to create a formula that
probably you don't see here in the panel
let me see if it's possible to show you
yeah okay now you see that
which is this formula where basically i
say keep on this cell
the difference between every
column of currency displayed
and a fixed column which is the gbp
okay so you can see the formula here
and then replicate this for all the
cells and
below for the previous period of line
so by having this i can observe
this chart just get
out of this i can also you can see we
have uh
the b2 minus f2 so we have the euro
minus the
gbp and in this case we have
the dollar minus the gbp
and in this case we have the canadian
minus the gbp
of course in the gbp we have zero
because we have the gbp minus the gpp
so in this case we consider gbp
as a referral line horizontal zero line
and then we see all the currencies that
are going up above or below
which is basically a different
representation where this
line of gbp is rectified and put
as a zero line but by doing this
i can observe some behaviors
that i could not notice very well
on this chart okay and
um for example in the day of today
uh starting at the point 69 which is
here okay uh
after our rising up
of all the other currencies against the
gbp
which means gbp weak because you have to
imagine this line is going down and all
the other currencies are going up
so strong all the other currencies
against the gbp
there was a stationary movement with
major
downs of in this case
we have canadian and australian dollar
and not breaking
some level levels like a kind of
resistance okay so not going up
anymore and
by analyzing
this chart together with this chart
specifically related to the gbp
i was capable for example today to
get at the beginning of the european
london session
the spike up of the gbp
because of course when all the
currencies are falling
against the zero line this zero line is
strong
and all the other currencies are getting
weak
okay so i could i could have two the
the major movement which is represented
in these very trades of the fifth
which are the gdp cad
gbp usd chf oz jpy
and new zealand in long direction
and of course eurogbp in a short
direction
so determining a gbp
strong and that was
this result here
this trade okay
yesterday was a different scenario
gbp was weak and gbp
has been traded weak with two
size two sizes
of 0.5 so one lot per
asset and as you may notice i got
for example the gbp usd where i took
half of the trades at a certain point of
the day
and i let the market go for some hours
more
but then closing because i was um
ending my day and my time
and so for example we have here gbp usd
that ended retracing but
which is this retracement back
okay but the overall performance was
in positive because i was right
determining gbp
week so
this is the reason why i also like to
trade with my own
property currencies trying meter
because this way i can do all the
formulas that i like
and i did many formulas and of course
the ones who have it can also do the
same
can also do the same approach and create
all the formulas they like and there
and develop their own creativity because
maybe they have
some intuitions i can create oscillators
i can create
averages everything related to the
currency
and in this case for trading a specific
currencies which is the most
important in the london session
i i opted for
creating some kind of graphical
representation
that could have gave me any kind of idea
of what
would have been going on with the gbp
for the day okay
so for those who were asking
uh
the results of what can be trading
by using math
for the market analysis an
average result of 60
65 70 percent
in a month can be pretty achievable
i'm saying a month i'm not meaning 30
days i'm meaning
just five days a week sometimes four
days a week
okay but you can scroll back the video
and check
the time i traded almost every day
okay so taking
the risk every day
as i said in one of my previous videos
my trading is based on math for about
75-80 percent
i'm not explaining all here because
it's something that is related to the
mentoring so something private that in
case i give
to those who are interested but what i
can say is that
the other 20 25
is related to some fundamental analysis
which is basically reading some news
possible news for the day
so having an economic calendar and
trying to match what the math
is saying and what are the
possible events
that can drive the markets and the
traders for the day
um this way my trading also has
some meaning by referring basically
always to math but also considering that
the markets are
moved because of some fundamental news
that can occur through the day
and that's it there's there is some also
technical analysis in the charts to
waiting for you know a
good point of entering the trades
but majority of time i wait you know
for something that it's related to
a news that can
suggest me went to trigger than the
trade
and also
for those who are willing maybe to trade
different sessions it's important to
notice that
every session has its own currencies
that are driving the most
so the asian
which involves basically oz ncd
and jpy the european
and london session which are driving are
driven by
gbp euro and swiss franc
always against the dollar both
and also the
american session where we have
basically canadian dollar
and the the us dollar
of course we have overlapping so
at the beginning of the london session
european london session we have also the
overlapping with the ending of the asian
and the results on overlapping between
the american
session and the european london session
so currencies can be
moved as well even if they are out
of their session but when we approach
the trading we should also focus on this
am i in a london session i trade one of
the currencies
against the dollar probably where
i have more probability that there is
some movement
because the markets are open okay
and i could do the same
just to give you an idea if i if i
want for example to analyze the
currencies against the us dollar
just to show you in real time what can
be
the meaning of doing math with
a currencies transmitter in this case
it's just simply that i instead of
selecting the
gbp i select the usd as a referral point
okay and then
i expand the formula
so now we are having the information
related to
the dollar and in fact as you can see
here the dollar
is getting weak and even here all the
currencies are getting strong
against the dollar which is now the new
zero line
okay so these things you cannot do them
with
normal expert advisors or for with the
strength meters that you find in the web
so i hope that this brief video
uh was is capable you know to
to explain some reasons why i have
developed this system this way
and why i'm using it and how i'm using
it
and of course for some other examples
rather than making the video long and
long and long
there are many information
planted in the my previous video so i
kindly invite you to
watch them in order to get your
extra answers prior to contact me
because i write i have very
few amount of time in these months and
so for this for answering some questions
in this sense
and also i hope to have given
some information and and
explanations and answered questions for
us regard the performance
that can be achievable while using
this kind of approach this kind of
mathematical approach rather than using
indicators or social
trading or things like that and also
automation because this is all
manual trading so every day
analysis of the market let's see if we
can do
an update in real time just to close
this video and conclude this session
let's wait a moment that i am updating
this yeah
so now i am basically updating the data
from metatrader
okay let's see if i did it right
and now we should see yeah some change
in the movement
of the currencies yeah here and here
okay this is
all for now and i hope to make some
videos
soon and
thanks for watching thanks for
subscribing because you're still
subscribing and still watching my videos
and for keeping in contact with me and
i do apologize for all the mails that
i'm not
answering but i i am doing some kind of
filtering
so the very strict males where they say
nothing
and they ask everything that won't be
the case
but i really do taking considerations
those of you
which are also presenting yourself
and giving me a good reason to have to
give an answer maybe for something that
i'm not covering with my videos
or things like that okay so
if you want to keep to make a contact
with me
consider that i have very limited amount
of time so i will be filtering
the nonsense emails from the ones that
are
having some meaning and they're bringing
something
okay so my contacts of course are on my
channel for us regarding email
or skype for those who are willing to
have a chat
of course accordingly always with my
scheduling
and with this i say
thanks again for watching even this
video after such a long time
and as usual because this is always
something that i wish you
wish to every one of you have a good
space
and have a good time bye
