hello fellow traders and welcome to
another episode of unconventional Forex
trading Channel I hope today to be
relatively brief today it's Friday the
6th of March 2020 I will show you
another practical example of
mathematical analysis applied to forex
market and the relative results just
bear with me for the length of this
video today I'm doing this video with a
specific request I got let's say I got
two requests in real a long the time but
with the second one always via email I
figured out that more of you would have
had some some questions like this
basically the question was that normally
I do make examples mirroring my trades
on demo accounts but I always use you
know
demo account with 10,000 units of currency
balance and also with a higher leverage
and the question that I got from one of
you I will not say the name of course
for privacy reasons but was pretty
legitimate to do... this guy was asking that
"how it's possible or if it's possible to
trade by having a normal set up of
account" what I mean I mean that this guy
was asking about I have about a thousand
euros to trade so not ten thousand but a
thousand euros and I'm also trading by
using an account with a leverage of a
100:1 okay so not five hundred
leverage but 100 leverage so as I
normally do not speak that much also
about money management and also lot size
for as regards trading positions
I decided during the week to made an
account for you know ..
for educational purposes and to do some
kind of replication of what is the
normal expectation of profit by using of
course my own methodology at least I can
speak for the way I do approach to forex
analysis and therefore forex trading but
it's something very subjective this is
not an invitation to trade or whatever
but
if you are interested in Forex
analysis whatever and you are not very
satisfied by indicators or fancy expert
advisors or trading robots and you are
more focused on manual trading anyway this
kind of approach seems to reveal good
results in terms of profitability even
with small accounts and with small
leverage which means restricted amount
of money that we can put in the
market and trade in order to get our
equity rising so as I will show you now
directly I would would go directly to
the point
I created my account as usual mirroring
the trade of today let's just have a
brief note on this so the account was
founded with 1000 units of Euro
anyway 1000 units and with a leverage of
a 100:1 you will also see
in the final statement of
course I traded just this morning within
the London session and of course I
closed my trades about half an hour
before the release of the non-farm
payrolls which of course can create some
some kind of big spikes and in the
beginning of the American session of
course ... but just to show what can be
done on a daily basis in terms of profit
by using some math and some analysis and
some logical considerations of course
this is related to a normal day trading
activity so I also measured lot size
okay and I got some kind of money
management on this just to give also an
example of how to behave within the
same circumstances where every normal
trader could afford
so roughly 1000 euros of balance and
trading lot sizes in this case of 0.03
so of course I'm running my usual
u.UFO expert advisor which of course
provides me strength and weakness of the
currencies this is a part of my strategy
and I'm using this in order to confirm
what I also have in my Excel
spreadsheets
I'm showing you here basically this is
the
this is the development of the day
always reading right to left so here we
have the currencies and here we have the
28 pairs normalized ... the black line that you
see here is basically the euro dollar
see if we can see that okay so this is
also the behavior of EURUSD ... markets
started here so here's the open of the
day and so we have the development of
all the currencies... normally my workflow
starts from the analysis of this Excel
spreadsheet and in conjunction also then
with a double confirmation provided by my
expert advisor u.UFO ... the one that I have
created and just prior to
proceed just a brief explanation on how
things are working in terms of analysis
basically I have these eight lines which
are 8 currencies that I get from my
calculations and so here I have the
black one is the New Zealand dollar the
brown is the Japanese yen the yellow is
a Swiss franc then a seat here the
purple is the GBP the green is the
AUD ... the Australian dollar then the
gray one is the CAD and red one is the
USD of course the blue
it's here is the EUR so from the
beginning of the day I started to see a
development of the currencies so the
first assumptions that that I made of
course I woke up just a couple of hours
before the starting of the European/London session where I was about to see some
strength of New Zealand dollar and
Japanese yen even with some of
oscillations of course but there was
this kind of strength there was also
starting weakness of the euro
but that was also going along with the
weakness of the USD... when I do
mentoring, to explain these things
deeply, I cannot I cannot make, you know, a
complete mentoring here, even because it will
take a lot of time and because it's
something that must be tailored to the
needs of everyone just to give you rough
information normally when I do consider
euro I also consider dollar so I
consider the euro dollar as the main
pair and so the main combination of
currencies that provides equilibrium in
the forex market so by following the
euro as a negative that someone could
have thought about thinking in terms of
selling euro in real that would have
been trade to do if the dollar would
have been on the positive side so if it
would have been on the buy side but as
you can see a euro and dollar let's see
this by making this simple double
EUR and USD were somehow going along
this way so this is always the beginning
of the day and blue is the Euro and red is
USD so even dollar was going down and
in fact there was a relative strength of
Euro against dollar therefore euro was
in a buy direction was long okay in fact
at this point 25 bars 15 minutes
timeframe from now the system now this
is the moment the present we got this
great divergence between euro and dollar
in favor of euro okay? so other
assumptions that I made... there was this
AUD moving.... of course we have to
understand that at the beginning of the
day in the asian session we had this
major currencies that then can preserve
the trend or revert the trend in the
following sessions which are AUD NZD
and JPY and then of course
in the next session take more place
EUR  GBP CHF and also of
course USD,related to
the other currencies ... also after checking
this scenario and figuring out what
would be what could have been the
setup of the day for trading
I also searched for some confirmation on
this chart on the right which basically
is like analyzing 28 currency pairs all
the time in just
one chart, because they are normalized
so as you may notice here we can see all
the currency pairs and therefore I
could have some information related
to certain currencies because for example
by watching as I told you the Euro
falling down as well the dollar falling
down I wanted to check for example the
EURCAD which was not falling that much
down and was also following the EURUSD
...in the sense of going up so
somehow I was thinking more to buy euro
than selling it okay?
but this is a process you know that
takes some moments ... a very small amount
of time compared to analyzing on
Metatrader 28 charts and clustering them
by currency which takes of course a lot
of more fatigue and mental stress
in order to figure out what to do
so after analyzing both the elements and
of course I can tell you briefly that by
having in order to have I will do an
update now so I will also give an
overview of how this this even if I'm a
previous videos and I strongly suggest
you to go back and watch them if you're
new to this channel I'll just show you
I will make an update so you will see
that these values are updating in real
time in a matter of seconds basically on
my Metatrader along with the UFO which
confirms anyway in the long term this is
the daily and of course this is the EURUSD
daily so we saw that the
Eurodollar was up of about a hundred
pips and in fact my values here are
confirming that EUR was positive and
USD was negative ...what else? we got
CADi very negative and we can see here
from our chart if we select only
the CAD for a second from the starting
of the day we got just this rise up with
this strong level of resistance that was
not broken and then going down then
returning back to the zero level and
then falling down this is the Canadian
dollar
okay so that was making sense to me
enough to inject my trades the way I did
it .. I was saying... on this Metatrader all
this expert advisor are created by me so
I exactly know what I'm doing
I had this expert advisor which
basically works in the sense of pulling
out data from Metatrader and creating
some .CSV files that then buy some
VBA operations in Excel are imported
in Excel and then are updated always in
Excel generating by updating all the
formulas that are in my tabs
and updating all the final results so
what we see here basically now is
creating a new data and the new data are
in the folder of Metatrader in the
folder files and we see here now is
creating again files are created and
left there
for some seconds to allow the user to
update Excel and then they are erased
and then they are recreated again why
this because this way the closes of the
present moment are always updated to the
latest values okay
so now we will wait some seconds then
the files are deleted now are they are
regenerated and if I go and now I start
to double click here see that this value
is going updating updating we are a
hundred percent data loaded and now I will
create an update of my files and you
will see they magically update... the charts
will update consequently with the latest
closes and of course there is this
advancement of course I decided to stop
my trades prior to the release of the
non-farm payrolls this is the first
Friday of the month because of the high
volatility and because we are going
towards the ending of the market so I
didn't want to messed up to much
because I already realized some tangible
profit that day by day can compound
my balance increasing it ok so basically
this is the way that I do my analysis
and of course of this as I'm using Excel
it's based on month so mathematical
formulas because in forex market and we
have this peculiarity which is unique
compared to any other kind of market
where currencies are related one to each
other as just because we are trading
pairs so when we trade euro dollar we
trade euro in one sense and the dollar
in the opposite sense and this goes for
each and every pair
therefore pairs establish a relation
that is stable between every currency okay? so
this is the unique to clarity that I
found and then that drives me every time
to choose the Forex market as my
preferred and unique market to trade
okay so by giving you a brief overview
of this I think it's enough and let's
proceed also showing you the trades that
I made today here is a brief recap of
course and let's see the results so I'm
showing you here the trades I made so you
can check and I strongly invite you as
usual to... because also someone can say oh
no but you're creating
something fake... whatever... so you can
always check the open time of the trades
and also the direction the currencies
that have been traded and the price I'm
not trading with stop-loss but I will
show you in a moment also regards the in
regards to the money management how do I
behave okay so first of all by having an
account of 1000 euros okay and 100
leverage okay
of course here is the date whatever when
I took the screenshot I had to act
consequently for as regards the sizing of
the lot of the Lots that I traded so I
decided to use this lot size for every
trade I made
..." shame on me"... something that I should
have considered as well because as you
may notice here I traded twice NZDCAD which was fine
but at the same time I could have also
trade and I don't know why I missed this
trade but it happens anyway could have
been positive as well because if I am
buying New Zealand dollar
therefore I am determining that CAD is weak
and for example in this case I sell
AUD and I buy JPY so I
decide that Japanese yen is strong I could
have also trade CADJPY
selling Canadian dollar and buying Yen
it would have been another trade
you know put in the list but in this
case I made only nine trades in
this  day instead of ten but that's
fine anyway so here is the result which
is really really really good in terms of
profit okay considering also that I got
just one 1.44 euro of commissions
so this was the total profit that
then I got to take off this costs
basically I made today the 12% on my
balance think in terms that a bank if
you give to them your money blocked in
in a fund for one year maybe you get
from one to two percent in one
year I made 12% in one day not even in
one day in some hours and therefore you
can make by yourself at least this math
because if you think in terms that you
can trade I don't know 20 days in a
month and compounding an average of 12%
sometimes can be ten other times can be
fifteen or twenty it depends also on the
volatilities to remember that today is
Friday by the end of the month you can
really achieve results like 150%
250% okay? ... by making 12/15%
every day and of course maybe not
trading all the days but let's say
twenty days in a month could be
sufficient so this is the profitability
of my analysis by trading
using a math analysis rather
than technical or fundamentals of course I'm
adding some fundamental analysis because
I spoke to you about the non-farm
payrolls which is a news event because
it has always to be something that you
have to be aware of because there are
also some traders that are taking
decisions and there are trading by the
data points that they are receiving from
the fundamental
News so it makes sense that also
fundamental news can affect the
direction of our currency of a currency
pair so being aware of that can add
another layer of security to our
trading which is important this is part
of the risk management okay
and of course by you can see by yourself
that by watching this chart
actually was one of the not very few
because in real if you trade with some
you know coherence and some
consciousness you can achieve resolve
like this as well which is a 100% of positive results with
basically no drawdown I got a drawdown
just of a couple of Units not that much
but was basically nothing and if you can
think that 123 euros
on 1.000 in six hours is not enough
for you maybe this is not a channel for
you but I think that by compounding
every day of trading an amount
like that by the end of the month it
could be a very good satisfaction at
least for me it is okay so you have to
ask yourself and answer yourself as well
so this is the statistics from my
trading and as a final answer in order
also to answer to my followers that
brought me about making an example like
this so more like within the real world
with a proportionate and realistic in
the realistic starting balance and
realistic realistic
Lot sizing and also some money
management in this case let's check it
out as well I always spoke about the
fact that I trade without using stop
losses in the traditional sense of stop
losses okay even to prove that by
analyzing with mathematical approach
it reduces drastically the risk, therefore
I test also my algorithms by not using
stop loss line that can be that the
broker can catch okay so I leave to the
pair's the ability to oscillate in order
to reach the point that I am targeting
okay but anyway I do use the concept of
stop loss in which way by using another
expert advisor that I created
which is very simple but at the same
time is very effective effective and
helps me to apply a money management
approach okay and let's see if I loaded
here probably no oh here is the CSV so
the two data from Metatrader here we
have the uUFO... let's see if we have
it here...  so basically here this is my
money manager okay which basically by
seeing the options I have only two
elements the stop loss level and the
take profit level okay which are set by
default this way but I can always change
them in real time so let's say that I
want to have a stop loss level of
-2%  and take profit level
of +15% okay and then I update my algorithm so here
you see my setup I have these values
that I just put in the form and
what do I mean with stop level in
percentage and take profit level I mean
that  if I made 9 trades
the overall level that will
immediately close all of my trades so
that I can rebuild my strategy and re-start
trading without losing that much money
will be the 2 percent on equity okay so
if I have 1000 euros of balance and the
overall trades all together there you go
below 20 euros just 2% okay
this expert advisor automatically will
close on the trades from me as well as
if I
have a profit so if my balance goes
above 150 euros which is
the 15% and take profit of
course I can give minus 2 percent
minus 5 percent minus 50 percent depends
on my attitude to risk but as I wanted
to make a normal example and also a good
behavioral  example for the ones that
requested via mail this question but also
for all the others 'cause it's important to
give the right awareness also for a
regards money management this is the way I
do but instead of calculating and always
watching my balance and equity whatever
I created a simple expert advisor that
does the job for me
ok so I don't have to think about that
once the orders are into the panel then
it's about this expert advisor to manage
the possible losses or possible profits
so this would be more easy of course I
am also in this moment I have a
break-even situation ok so there's no
trading of course I am
the also the unnerved if I am in loss or
in profit I have also here a hundred 100
leverage situation and of course when
the trays are running I have also the
percentage and the number of the orders
that I have on and my balance and my
equity moving of course so I have all
the information that I need recapped
here for simplicity ... in terms of
analyzing the trades of course we can
see without no problems about the euro
dollar let's see
... EURUSD...
I started trading around this time so
this were the pips more or less that I
realized
also let me remember I got the EURCAD
started around this time
okay what else I got
I was not that much happy with GBPAUD
but that's fine let's check this you
know this was this messy situation so I
barely got it in pair by after a
certain point but there was not that
much probably because of the non-farm
payrolls regarding the next American
session that anyway there was this
ranging phase that would have been you
know somehow leveling at least that
trade .. what else made... the AUDJPY and
yeah but I read anyway for a GBP that
against AUD when not that well the GBP
against the CAD was
more than positive okay and also the
AUDJPY was we were saying
was oscillating so there
was this battle between GBP and AUD
but at the end it was winning the JPY
against the AUD of course I suffered
a little bit in this point so
about twenty pips down but it was
compensating by other currencies that
were more than positive and going about
you know roughly 40 pips what else
we got?
USDJPY and EURCAD okay and
USDJPY was about here so I got 80 pips
and yeah what I miss it was the CAD in
Sell Japanese yen in Buy which was most
similar but I repeat once you identify
the currencies there are strong and weak
as I already largely explained in my
previous webinars and videos then you
know how to set up coherently the pairs
accordingly to the strength and the
weakness so if you trade euro dollar in buy
then you will not buy dollar against
something else because ...
if you're if you're buying
euro and selling dollar this selling
dollar has to be for all the other pairs
so you will...
it's it's a double confirmation that you
know for sure that USDJPY is most
is most likely to go to be Sell rather
than Buy okay? so there is a logic in
this kind
of approach that helps also to organize
the order the orders ...with a coherent
setup okay in order to create that
synthetic pair which is the equation
generated by putting the orders together
with buy and sell order so I think that
for today and for this
explanation this is quite all that I
wanted to say and I hope that by showing
this example I properly answered to the
questions I got and gave also not only
by typing some words but take a
practical example of how to behave and
also how to consider the money
management and so it's all for that and
as usual I wish you a good weekend good
ending of the week and also a good
starting of the week and trading week as
well and I wish of course
Good Space 'n' Good Time!
bye!!!
